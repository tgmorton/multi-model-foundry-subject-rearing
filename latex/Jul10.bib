@article{Cao2021-xi,
	abstract = {Despite the recent success of neural network models in
                   mimicking animal performance on visual perceptual tasks,
                   critics worry that these models fail to illuminate brain
                   function. We take it that a central approach to explanation
                   in systems neuroscience is that of mechanistic modeling,
                   where understanding the system is taken to require fleshing
                   out the parts, organization, and activities of a system, and
                   how those give rise to behaviors of interest. However, it
                   remains somewhat controversial what it means for a model to
                   describe a mechanism, and whether neural network models
                   qualify as explanatory. We argue that certain kinds of neural
                   network models are actually good examples of mechanistic
                   models, when the right notion of mechanistic mapping is
                   deployed. Building on existing work on model-to-mechanism
                   mapping (3M), we describe criteria delineating such a notion,
                   which we call 3M++. These criteria require us, first, to
                   identify a level of description that is both abstract but
                   detailed enough to be ``runnable'', and then, to construct
                   model-to-brain mappings using the same principles as those
                   employed for brain-to-brain mapping across individuals.
                   Perhaps surprisingly, the abstractions required are those
                   already in use in experimental neuroscience, and are of the
                   kind deployed in the construction of more familiar
                   computational models, just as the principles of inter-brain
                   mappings are very much in the spirit of those already
                   employed in the collection and analysis of data across
                   animals. In a companion paper, we address the relationship
                   between optimization and intelligibility, in the context of
                   functional evolutionary explanations. Taken together,
                   mechanistic interpretations of computational models and the
                   dependencies between form and function illuminated by
                   optimization processes can help us to understand why brain
                   systems are built they way they are.},

@article{Varma2023-dl,
	abstract = {One of the most surprising puzzles in neural network
                   generalisation is grokking: a network with perfect training
                   accuracy but poor generalisation will, upon further training,
                   transition to perfect generalisation. We propose that
                   grokking occurs when the task admits a generalising solution
                   and a memorising solution, where the generalising solution is
                   slower to learn but more efficient, producing larger logits
                   with the same parameter norm. We hypothesise that memorising
                   circuits become more inefficient with larger training
                   datasets while generalising circuits do not, suggesting there
                   is a critical dataset size at which memorisation and
                   generalisation are equally efficient. We make and confirm
                   four novel predictions about grokking, providing significant
                   evidence in favour of our explanation. Most strikingly, we
                   demonstrate two novel and surprising behaviours: ungrokking,
                   in which a network regresses from perfect to low test
                   accuracy, and semi-grokking, in which a network shows delayed
                   generalisation to partial rather than perfect test accuracy.},

	abstract = {In this paper we propose to study generalization of neural
                   networks on small algorithmically generated datasets. In this
                   setting, questions about data efficiency, memorization,
                   generalization, and speed of learning can be studied in great
                   detail. In some situations we show that neural networks learn
                   through a process of ``grokking'' a pattern in the data,
                   improving generalization performance from random chance level
                   to perfect generalization, and that this improvement in
                   generalization can happen well past the point of overfitting.
                   We also study generalization as a function of dataset size
                   and find that smaller datasets require increasing amounts of
                   optimization for generalization. We argue that these datasets
                   provide a fertile ground for studying a poorly understood
                   aspect of deep learning: generalization of overparametrized

	abstract = {Abstract We investigate how neural language models acquire
               individual words during training, extracting learning curves and
               ages of acquisition for over 600 words on the MacArthur-Bates
               Communicative Development Inventory (Fenson et al., 2007).
               Drawing on studies of word acquisition in children, we evaluate
               multiple predictors for words' ages of acquisition in LSTMs,
               BERT, and GPT-2. We find that the effects of concreteness, word
               length, and lexical class are pointedly different in children and
               language models, reinforcing the importance of interaction and
               sensorimotor experience in child language acquisition. Language
               models rely far more on word frequency than children, but, like
               children, they exhibit slower learning of words in longer
               utterances. Interestingly, models follow consistent patterns
               during training for both unidirectional and bidirectional models,
               and for both LSTM and Transformer architectures. Models predict
               based on unigram token frequencies early in training, before
               transitioning loosely to bigram probabilities, eventually
               converging on more nuanced predictions. These results shed light
               on the role of distributional learning mechanisms in children,
               while also providing insights for more human-like language
               acquisition in language models.},

               before mean length of utterance (MLU) 2.0. On balance,
               performance factors account for the data best. Natural

               1;10 to 2;8 and in MLU from 1.53 to 4.38) and their mothers were
               taped, transcribed, and analyzed to determine when American
               children understand that English requires subjects. We measured
               the frequency of subjects (Study 1); types of pronominal
               subjects, including expletives (Study 2); frequency of modals and
               semi-auxiliaries (Study 3); frequency of infinitival to, past

               group (5 children between 1.5 and 1.99) used subjects and

               No. 160). Patterns of structure and variation are described in
               the language development of four children in the period in which
               mean length of utterance progressed from 1.0 to approximately 2.5
               morphemes. Verb relations were of central importance in the
               children's language learning, and there was a similar
               developmental sequence among the children in the emergence of
               several semantic-syntactic categories of verb relations. Possible
               linguistic and cognitive explanations for the obtained
               developmental sequence are discussed. There was variation among
               the children in the lexical representation in utterances:
               although all four children presented the same semantics in their
               utterances-they talked about the same kinds of things and in the
               same sequence in the course of development-they did not use the
               same linguistic means for representing the same information. Two
               of the children learned a system of pronominal reference to
               persons and objects in verb relations, whereas the other two
               children learned categories of nominal forms relative to verbs.
               The developments within each system were orderly and predictable
               across time as each child proceeded to learn the other system and
               thereby acquired the capacity for alternative pronominal and
               nominal reference.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a new model for null subjects, and focuses on
               its implications for language development. The literature on
               pro-drop generally considers that not allowing null subjects is,
               informally speaking, the ``default'' option in natural languages,
               and appeals to particular morphosyntactic mechanisms in order to
               account for those languages in which the subject can be omitted.
               Shifting the perspective, the inverse approach postulates that
               pro-drop is (almost) a default grammatical setting, and that
               non-pro-drop results from the intervention of independent factors
               that block pro-drop in the derivation. The paper explores the
               consequences of the inverse approach in the domain of language
               acquisition, arguing that this model allows to account for a
               number of properties of child languages. It opens an avenue of
               research worth exploring, one that could give new solutions to
               old problems.},

               within the Government/Binding Theory of Chomsky (1981),
               grammatical development is viewed as a process whereby the child
               `fixes' the parameters of Universal Grammar (UG) at the values
               which are appropriate for the particular adult language he is to
               acquire. The parameters of UG provide the child with a limited
               number of grammatical options; these options express the narrow
               range of variation which adult languages exhibit with respect to
               some aspect of grammar. Of course, in addition to fixing the
               parameters of UG, the child must also acquire the idiosyncratic
               or peripheral aspects of his language, which may be unrelated or

                   therefore employs psycholinguistic paradigms in English,
                   which are well-suited for probing deeper cognitive aspects of
                   language processing, to explore neuron-level representations
                   in language model across three tasks: sound-shape
                   association, sound-gender association, and implicit
                   causality. Our findings indicate that while GPT-2-XL
                   struggles with the sound-shape task, it demonstrates
                   human-like abilities in both sound-gender association and

                   behaviors of machine learning models in terms of their

                   focuses on simple behaviors in small models, or describes
                   complicated behaviors in larger models with broad strokes. In
                   this work, we bridge this gap by presenting an explanation
                   for how GPT-2 small performs a natural language task called
                   indirect object identification (IOI). Our explanation
                   encompasses 26 attention heads grouped into 7 main classes,
                   which we discovered using a combination of interpretability
                   approaches relying on causal interventions. To our knowledge,
                   this investigation is the largest end-to-end attempt at
                   reverse-engineering a natural behavior ``in the wild'' in a

               cognitive processing is better explained by symbolic rules or by
               subsymbolic neural networks. A recent study of infant
               familiarization to sentences in an artificial language seems to
               have produced data that can only be explained by symbolic rule
               learning and not by unstructured neural networks (Marcus,
               Vijayan, Bandi Rao, \& Vishton, 1999). Here we present successful
               unstructured neural network simulations of the infant data,
               showing that these data do not uniquely support a rule-based
               account. In contrast to other simulations of these data, these
               simulations cover more aspects of the data with fewer assumptions
               about prior knowledge and training, using a more realistic coding
               scheme based on sonority of phonemes. The networks show
               exponential decreases in attention to a repeated sentence
               pattern, more recovery to novel sentences inconsistent with the
               familiar pattern than to novel sentences consistent with the
               familiar pattern, occasional familiarity preferences, more
               recovery to consistent novel sentences than to familiarized
               sentences, and extrapolative generalization outside the range of
               the training patterns. A variety of predictions suggest the
               utility of the model in guiding future psychological work. The

	abstract = {Interpretability research often aims to predict how a model
                   will respond to targeted interventions on specific
                   mechanisms. However, it rarely predicts how a model will
                   respond to unseen input data. This paper explores the
                   promises and challenges of interpretability as a tool for
                   predicting out-of-distribution (OOD) model behavior.
                   Specifically, we investigate the correspondence between
                   attention patterns and OOD generalization in hundreds of
                   Transformer models independently trained on a synthetic
                   classification task. These models exhibit several distinct
                   systematic generalization rules OOD, forming a diverse
                   population for correlational analysis. In this setting, we
                   find that simple observational tools from interpretability
                   can predict OOD performance. In particular, when
                   in-distribution attention exhibits hierarchical patterns, the
                   model is likely to generalize hierarchically on OOD data --
                   even when the rule's implementation does not rely on these
                   hierarchical patterns, according to ablation tests. Our
                   findings offer a proof-of-concept to motivate further
                   interpretability work on predicting unseen model behavior.},

                   motivating gradient accumulation, which trades off the number
                   of optimizer steps for a proportional increase in batch size.
                   While it is common to decrease the learning rate for smaller
                   batch sizes, other hyperparameters are often held fixed. In

                   the environment. However, without appropriate knowledge and
                   exploration, skills may provide control only over a
                   restricted area of the environment, limiting their
                   applicability. Furthermore, it is unclear how to leverage the
                   learned skill behaviors for adapting to downstream tasks in a
                   data-efficient manner. We present Choreographer, a
                   model-based agent that exploits its world model to learn and
                   adapt skills in imagination. Our method decouples the
                   exploration and skill learning processes, being able to
                   discover skills in the latent state space of the model.
                   During adaptation, the agent uses a meta-controller to
                   evaluate and adapt the learned skills efficiently by
                   deploying them in parallel in imagination. Choreographer is

                   collecting data simultaneously with an exploration policy.
                   The skills can be used to effectively adapt to downstream
                   tasks, as we show in the URL benchmark, where we outperform
                   previous approaches from both pixels and states inputs. The

                   thinking. While current Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel
                   at System 2 thinking, their inability to perform fast
                   thinking leads to high computational overhead and latency. In
                   this work, we enable LRMs to approximate human intelligence
                   through dynamic thinking speed adjustment, optimizing
                   accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Our approach addresses two
                   key questions: (1) how to control thinking speed in LRMs, and
                   (2) when to adjust it for optimal performance. For the first
                   question, we identify the steering vector that governs
                   slow-fast thinking transitions in LRMs' representation space.
                   Using this vector, we achieve the first representation

                   representational building blocks of cognition, what are the
                   rules via which those primitives combine, and where do these
                   primitives and rules come from in the first place? A
                   long-standing debate concerns the adequacy of artificial
                   neural networks as computational models that can answer these
                   questions, in particular in domains related to abstract
                   cognitive function, such as language and logic. This paper
                   argues that recent advances in neural networks --
                   specifically, the advent of large language models (LLMs) --
                   represent an important shift in this debate. We test a
                   variety of LLMs on an existing experimental paradigm used for
                   studying the induction of rules formulated over logical
                   concepts. Across four experiments, we find converging
                   empirical evidence that LLMs provide at least as good a fit
                   to human behavior as models that implement a Bayesian
                   probablistic language of thought (pLoT), which have been the
                   best computational models of human behavior on the same task.
                   Moreover, we show that the LLMs make qualitatively different
                   predictions about the nature of the rules that are inferred
                   and deployed in order to complete the task, indicating that
                   the LLM is unlikely to be a mere implementation of the pLoT
                   solution. Based on these results, we argue that LLMs may
                   instantiate a novel theoretical account of the primitive
                   representations and computations necessary to explain human
                   logical concepts, with which future work in cognitive science

                   are factually incorrect yet expressed with high confidence,
                   which can pose serious risks for end users. To address this,
                   it is essential for LLMs not only to produce answers but also
                   to provide accurate estimates of their correctness.
                   Uncertainty quantification methods have been introduced to
                   assess the quality of LLM outputs, with factual accuracy
                   being a key aspect of that quality. Among these methods,
                   those that leverage hidden states to train probes have shown
                   particular promise, as these internal representations encode
                   information relevant to the factuality of responses, making
                   this approach the focus of this paper. However, the probe
                   trained on the hidden states of one dataset often struggles
                   to generalise to another dataset of a different task or
                   domain. To address this limitation, we explore combining
                   data-agnostic features with hidden-state features and assess
                   whether this hybrid feature set enhances out-of-domain
                   performance. We further examine whether selecting only the
                   most informative hidden-state features, thereby discarding
                   task-specific noise, enables the data-agnostic features to
                   contribute more effectively. The experiment results indicate
                   that although introducing data-agnostic features generally
                   enhances generalisation performance in most cases, in certain
                   scenarios their inclusion degrades performance. A similar
                   pattern emerges when retaining only the most important
                   hidden-state features - adding data-agnostic features does
                   not consistently further enhance performance compared to
                   using the full set of hidden-state features. A closer
                   analysis reveals that, in some specific cases, the trained
                   probe underweights the data-agnostic features relative to the
                   hidden-state features, which we believe is the main reason
                   why the results are inconclusive.},

                   optimize on unlearning targets, and more effectively removes
                   private information from model outputs. Overall, our
                   contributions represent an important step toward more

                   architectures are well suited to training at long sequence
                   lengths: the cost of processing the context is too expensive
                   in the former, too inexpensive in the latter. Approaches such
                   as sliding window attention which reduce the cost-per-token
                   of a transformer impair in-context learning, and so are also
                   unsuitable. To address these limitations, we introduce power
                   attention, an architectural layer for linear-cost sequence
                   modeling whose state size can be adjusted independently of
                   parameters, unlocking the advantages of linear attention on

                   strategies for processing sequences are typically categorized
                   as channel-independent and channel-mixing. The former treats
                   all temporal information of each variable as a token,
                   focusing on capturing local temporal features of individual
                   variables, while the latter constructs a token from the
                   multivariate information at each time step, emphasizing the
                   modeling of global temporal dependencies. Current mainstream
                   models are mostly based on Transformer and the emerging
                   Mamba. Transformers excel at modeling global dependencies
                   through self-attention mechanisms but exhibit limited
                   sensitivity to local temporal patterns and suffer from
                   quadratic computational complexity, restricting their
                   efficiency in long-sequence processing. In contrast, Mamba,
                   based on state space models (SSMs), achieves linear
                   complexity and efficient long-range modeling but struggles to
                   aggregate global contextual information in parallel. To
                   overcome the limitations of both models, we propose
                   DC-Mamber, a dual-channel forecasting model based on Mamba
                   and linear Transformer for time series forecasting.
                   Specifically, the Mamba-based channel employs a
                   channel-independent strategy to extract intra-variable
                   features, while the Transformer-based channel adopts a
                   channel-mixing strategy to model cross-timestep global
                   dependencies. DC-Mamber first maps the raw input into two
                   distinct feature representations via separate embedding
                   layers. These representations are then processed by a
                   variable encoder (built on Mamba) and a temporal encoder
                   (built on linear Transformer), respectively. Finally, a
                   fusion layer integrates the dual-channel features for
                   prediction. Extensive experiments on eight public datasets
                   confirm DC-Mamber's superior accuracy over existing models.},

                   the validity of a growing body of research. Guided by the

                   code text requires basic reliability and accuracy, while
                   claims about psychological properties demand comprehensive

                   their research goal and corresponding validity requirements,
                   (2) develop and validate computational instruments through
                   psychometric testing, (3) design experiments that control for
                   computational confounds, (4) execute protocols with

                   embodied, communicative agents. To address this gap, our work
                   introduces a multimodal dataset and framework for grounded

                   because of the rising needs to develop virtual agents with
                   artificial (general) intelligence. There has been much debate
                   on what a world model really is, how to build it, how to use
                   it, and how to evaluate it. In this essay, starting from the
                   imagination in the famed Sci-Fi classic Dune, and drawing
                   inspiration from the concept of ``hypothetical thinking'' in

                   model selection, clouds model comparisons, and adds confusion
                   to a growing ecosystem of competing models. Recent work
                   attributed ranking disagreement to the phenomenon of training
                   on the test task: As released, different models exhibit a
                   different level of preparation for any given test task. A

                   evaluation of train-before-test across 24 benchmarks and 61
                   models. We show that train-before-test significantly improves

                   training methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human

                   short in fostering truly empathetic, adaptive, and

               hallmark of human linguistic abilities. However, its underlying
               neural mechanisms remain largely unknown. We studied whether a
               modern artificial neural network trained with ``deep learning''
               methods mimics a central aspect of human sentence processing,
               namely the storing of grammatical number and gender information
               in working memory and its use in long-distance agreement (e.g.,
               capturing the correct number agreement between subject and verb
               when they are separated by other phrases). Although the network,
               a recurrent architecture with Long Short-Term Memory units, was
               solely trained to predict the next word in a large corpus,
               analysis showed the emergence of a very sparse set of specialized
               units that successfully handled local and long-distance syntactic
               agreement for grammatical number. However, the simulations also
               showed that this mechanism does not support full recursion and
               fails with some long-range embedded dependencies. We tested the
               model's predictions in a behavioral experiment where humans
               detected violations in number agreement in sentences with
               systematic variations in the singular/plural status of multiple
               nouns, with or without embedding. Human and model error patterns
               were remarkably similar, showing that the model echoes various
               effects observed in human data. However, a key difference was
               that, with embedded long-range dependencies, humans remained
               above chance level, while the model's systematic errors brought
               it below chance. Overall, our study shows that exploring the ways
               in which modern artificial neural networks process sentences

                   language: the time it takes human subjects to read a word can
                   be predicted from estimates of the word's probability in
                   context. However, it remains an open question what
                   computational architecture best characterizes the
                   expectations deployed in real time by humans that determine
                   the behavioral signatures of reading. Here we test over two
                   dozen models, independently manipulating computational
                   architecture and training dataset size, on how well their
                   next-word expectations predict human reading time behavior on
                   naturalistic text corpora. We find that across model

                   between word log-probability and reading time is
                   (near-)linear. We next evaluate how features of these models
                   determine their psychometric predictive power, or ability to
                   predict human reading behavior. In general, the better a
                   model's next-word expectations, the better its psychometric
                   predictive power. However, we find nontrivial differences
                   across model architectures. For any given perplexity, deep
                   Transformer models and n-gram models generally show superior
                   psychometric predictive power over LSTM or structurally
                   supervised neural models, especially for eye movement data.
                   Finally, we compare models' psychometric predictive power to
                   the depth of their syntactic knowledge, as measured by a
                   battery of syntactic generalization tests developed using
                   methods from controlled psycholinguistic experiments. Once

                   performing a particular evaluation -- that may mask the

                   measuring the capacities of language models (LMs):
                   performance on a task is a function of the model's underlying

               of grammar, and that independent performance constraints limit
               recursive abilities that would otherwise be infinite. This
               article presents a usage‐based perspective on recursive sentence
               processing, in which recursion is construed as an acquired skill
               and in which limitations on the processing of recursive
               constructions stem from interactions between linguistic

               A connectionist model embodying this alternative theory is

               many behavioral traits and, in some of these cases, the
               psychological mechanisms behind them. Comparing behavior and
               cognition across multiple species can help scientists to pinpoint
               why and when in phylogenetic history a behavior may have evolved,
               how it evolved, and what the mechanisms behind it are (Tinbergen,
               1963). While the comparative approach has proven quite effective
               in addressing these questions, comparing behavior across multiple
               species is not as easy and straightforward as it may initially
               seem. Rigorous methodology and careful interpretation of results
               is crucial to answering any of these questions definitively. The

                   However, human abstract reasoning is also imperfect. For
                   example, human reasoning is affected by our real-world
                   knowledge and beliefs, and shows notable ``content effects'';
                   humans reason more reliably when the semantic content of a
                   problem supports the correct logical inferences. These
                   content-entangled reasoning patterns play a central role in
                   debates about the fundamental nature of human intelligence.
                   Here, we investigate whether language models
                   $\unicode{x2014}$ whose prior expectations capture some
                   aspects of human knowledge $\unicode{x2014}$ similarly mix

                   language inference, judging the logical validity of
                   syllogisms, and the Wason selection task. We evaluate state

                   that the language models reflect many of the same patterns

               abstract ordering preferences (e.g., preferences for short words

                   arithmetic precision is logarithmic in the number of input
                   tokens (and whose feedforward nets are computable using space
                   linear in their input) can be simulated by constant-depth

                   representations as `neural activations', we decode
                   grammaticality labels of minimal pairs from the intermediate
                   layers' representations. This approach reveals: 1)
                   Self-supervised language models capture abstract linguistic
                   structures in intermediate layers that GloVe and RNN language
                   models cannot learn. 2) Information about syntactic
                   grammaticality is robustly captured through the first third
                   layers of GPT-2 and also distributed in later layers. As
                   sentence complexity increases, more layers are required for
                   learning grammatical capabilities. 3) Morphological and
                   semantics/syntax interface-related features are harder to
                   capture than syntax. 4) For Transformer-based models, both
                   embeddings and attentions capture grammatical features but
                   show distinct patterns. Different attention heads exhibit
                   similar tendencies toward various linguistic phenomena, but
                   with varied contributions.},

                   models at one snapshot in time (the end of pre-training),
                   raising the question of whether their results generalize to
                   real-world settings. Existing studies of mechanisms over time
                   focus on encoder-only or toy models, which differ
                   significantly from most deployed models. In this study, we

                   sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but
                   underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover,
                   despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of
                   quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to
                   poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on
                   understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention
                   in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier
                   between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language
                   modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and
                   attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two
                   capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and
                   comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the
                   impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3,
                   that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches
                   attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL
                   of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid
                   125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention
                   layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText
                   by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs
                   on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a
                   fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences
                   up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that
                   exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer
                   sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\times$ speedup on the
                   long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models
                   to generate text 2.4$\times$ faster than Transformers. Using
                   FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to
                   2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial
                   results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and

                   attention-based models are a popular and effective choice in
                   modeling short-range interactions, their performance on tasks

                   In an exciting result, Gu et al. (ICLR 2022) proposed the
                   $\textit{Structured State Space}$ (S4) architecture
                   delivering large gains over state-of-the-art models on

                   effective as a deep learning layer as a promising alternative
                   to sequence models such as RNNs, CNNs, or Transformers. The
                   first version to show this potential was the S4 model, which
                   is particularly effective on tasks involving long-range
                   dependencies by using a prescribed state matrix called the
                   HiPPO matrix. While this has an interpretable mathematical
                   mechanism for modeling long dependencies, it introduces a
                   custom representation and algorithm that can be difficult to
                   implement. On the other hand, a recent variant of S4 called
                   DSS showed that restricting the state matrix to be fully
                   diagonal can still preserve the performance of the original
                   model when using a specific initialization based on
                   approximating S4's matrix. This work seeks to systematically
                   understand how to parameterize and initialize such diagonal
                   state space models. While it follows from classical results
                   that almost all SSMs have an equivalent diagonal form, we
                   show that the initialization is critical for performance. We
                   explain why DSS works mathematically, by showing that the
                   diagonal restriction of S4's matrix surprisingly recovers the
                   same kernel in the limit of infinite state dimension. We also
                   systematically describe various design choices in
                   parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and perform a
                   controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these
                   choices. Our final model S4D is a simple diagonal version of
                   S4 whose kernel computation requires just 2 lines of code and
                   performs comparably to S4 in almost all settings, with

                   and CNNs have previously been tailored to fit the demands of

                   computational tradeoffs and struggle to model waveforms
                   effectively. We propose SaShiMi, a new multi-scale
                   architecture for waveform modeling built around the recently
                   introduced S4 model for long sequence modeling. We identify
                   that S4 can be unstable during autoregressive generation, and
                   provide a simple improvement to its parameterization by

                   SaShiMi improves non-autoregressive generation performance
                   when used as the backbone architecture for a diffusion model.
                   Compared to prior architectures in the autoregressive
                   generation setting, SaShiMi generates piano and speech
                   waveforms which humans find more musical and coherent
                   respectively, e.g. 2x better mean opinion scores than WaveNet
                   on an unconditional speech generation task. On a music

	abstract = {The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) makes
                   it important to recognize their strengths and limitations. We
                   argue that in order to develop a holistic understanding of
                   these systems we need to consider the problem that they were
                   trained to solve: next-word prediction over Internet text. By
                   recognizing the pressures that this task exerts we can make
                   predictions about the strategies that LLMs will adopt,
                   allowing us to reason about when they will succeed or fail.
                   This approach - which we call the teleological approach -
                   leads us to identify three factors that we hypothesize will
                   influence LLM accuracy: the probability of the task to be
                   performed, the probability of the target output, and the
                   probability of the provided input. We predict that LLMs will
                   achieve higher accuracy when these probabilities are high
                   than when they are low - even in deterministic settings where
                   probability should not matter. To test our predictions, we
                   evaluate two LLMs (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) on eleven tasks, and we
                   find robust evidence that LLMs are influenced by probability
                   in the ways that we have hypothesized. In many cases, the
                   experiments reveal surprising failure modes. For instance,
                   GPT-4's accuracy at decoding a simple cipher is 51\% when the
                   output is a high-probability word sequence but only 13\% when
                   it is low-probability. These results show that AI
                   practitioners should be careful about using LLMs in
                   low-probability situations. More broadly, we conclude that we
                   should not evaluate LLMs as if they are humans but should
                   instead treat them as a distinct type of system - one that
                   has been shaped by its own particular set of pressures.},

                   applications in deep learning, are almost universally based
                   on the Transformer architecture and its core attention
                   module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear
                   attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and
                   structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to
                   address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long
                   sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention
                   on important modalities such as language. We identify that a
                   key weakness of such models is their inability to perform
                   content-based reasoning, and make several improvements.
                   First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the
                   input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities,
                   allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget
                   information along the sequence length dimension depending on
                   the current token. Second, even though this change prevents
                   the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware
                   parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these
                   selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network
                   architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).
                   Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\times$ higher throughput than
                   Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its
                   performance improves on real data up to million-length
                   sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba
                   achieves state-of-the-art performance across several

                   architectural similarity to recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
                   But do SSMs truly have an advantage (over transformers) in
                   expressive power for state tracking? Surprisingly, the answer
                   is no. Our analysis reveals that the expressive power of SSMs
                   is limited very similarly to transformers: SSMs cannot
                   express computation outside the complexity class
                   $\mathsf{TC}^0$. In particular, this means they cannot solve
                   simple state-tracking problems like permutation composition.
                   It follows that SSMs are provably unable to accurately track
                   chess moves with certain notation, evaluate code, or track
                   entities in a long narrative. To supplement our formal
                   analysis, we report experiments showing that Mamba-style SSMs
                   indeed struggle with state tracking. Thus, despite its
                   recurrent formulation, the ``state'' in an SSM is an
                   illusion: SSMs have similar expressiveness limitations to
                   non-recurrent models like transformers, which may
                   fundamentally limit their ability to solve real-world
                   state-tracking problems.},

                   analysis of their power in terms of formal languages. Recent
                   work has shown that transformers with hard attention are
                   quite limited in power (Hahn, 2020), as they can be simulated
                   by constant-depth AND/OR circuits (Hao et al. 2021). However,
                   hard attention is a strong assumption, which may complicate
                   the relevance of these results in practice. In this work, we
                   analyze the circuit complexity of transformers with saturated

                   closely captures the attention patterns learnable in
                   practical transformers. We first show that saturated

                   hard-attention transformers. We then prove saturated
                   transformers with floating-point values can be simulated by
                   constant-depth threshold circuits, giving the class

                   purely behavioural measures (e.g., surprisal comparisons). At
                   the same time, research in model interpretability has begun
                   to illuminate the abstract causal mechanisms shaping LM

                   interpretability methods to causally affect model behaviour.

                   fundamental to cognitive processing, impacting areas such as
                   memory, vision, and language. However, animacy is not always
                   expressed directly in language: in English it often manifests
                   indirectly, in the form of selectional constraints on verbs
                   and adjectives. This poses a potential issue for transformer
                   language models (LMs): they often train only on text, and
                   thus lack access to extralinguistic information from which
                   humans learn about animacy. We ask: how does this impact LMs'
                   animacy processing - do they still behave as humans do? We
                   answer this question using open-source LMs. Like previous
                   studies, we find that LMs behave much like humans when
                   presented with entities whose animacy is typical. However, we
                   also show that even when presented with stories about
                   atypically animate entities, such as a peanut in love, LMs
                   adapt: they treat these entities as animate, though they do
                   not adapt as well as humans. Even when the context indicating
                   atypical animacy is very short, LMs pick up on subtle clues
                   and change their behavior. We conclude that despite the
                   limited signal through which LMs can learn about animacy,
                   they are indeed sensitive to the relevant lexical semantic

                   networks' internals is \textit{polysemanticity}, where
                   neurons appear to activate in multiple, semantically distinct
                   contexts. Polysemanticity prevents us from identifying
                   concise, human-understandable explanations for what neural
                   networks are doing internally. One hypothesised cause of
                   polysemanticity is \textit{superposition}, where neural
                   networks represent more features than they have neurons by
                   assigning features to an overcomplete set of directions in
                   activation space, rather than to individual neurons. Here, we
                   attempt to identify those directions, using sparse
                   autoencoders to reconstruct the internal activations of a
                   language model. These autoencoders learn sets of sparsely
                   activating features that are more interpretable and
                   monosemantic than directions identified by alternative
                   approaches, where interpretability is measured by automated
                   methods. Moreover, we show that with our learned set of
                   features, we can pinpoint the features that are causally

               progress. The chief insight of the book is that languages are
               real patterns found in special kinds of biological systems.
               Importantly, many of the theories and achievements of Chomskyan
               generative grammar and biolinguistics can be retained within this
               new understanding of the field. Nevertheless, aspects of

               renewed attention within a theory of language. Methodologically,
               this makes linguistics a complexity science and opens up a world

               asserts Daniel Dennett in this first full-scale presentation of a

               twenty years. We adopt a stance, he argues, a predictive strategy

               psychology and their corresponding terms in cognitive

               over the years, his views have undergone successive enrichments,
               refinements, and extensions. ``The Intentional Stance'' brings
               together both previously published and original material: four of
               the book's ten chapters - its first and the final three - appear
               here for the first time and push the theory into surprising new
               territory. The remaining six were published earlier in the 1980s
               but were not easily accessible; each is followed by a reflection
               - an essay reconsidering and extending the claims of the earlier
               work. These reflections and the new chapters represent the
               vanguard of Dennett's thought. They reveal fresh lines of inquiry

               everyday life, in our daily interactions? Through the use of such
               ``folk'' concepts as belief, desire, intention, and expectation,
               asserts Daniel Dennett in this first full-scale presentation of a
               theory of intentionality that he has been developing for almost
               twenty years. We adopt a stance, he argues, a predictive strategy
               of interpretation that presupposes the rationality of the people
               - or other entities - we are hoping to understand and
               predict.These principles of radical interpretation have
               far-reaching implications for the metaphysical and scientific
               status of the processes referred to by the everday terms of folk
               psychology and their corresponding terms in cognitive
               science.While Dennett's philosophical stance has been steadfast
               over the years, his views have undergone successive enrichments,
               refinements, and extensions. ``The Intentional Stance'' brings
               together both previously published and original material: four of
               the book's ten chapters - its first and the final three - appear
               here for the first time and push the theory into surprising new
               territory. The remaining six were published earlier in the 1980s
               but were not easily accessible; each is followed by a reflection
               - an essay reconsidering and extending the claims of the earlier
               work. These reflections and the new chapters represent the
               vanguard of Dennett's thought. They reveal fresh lines of inquiry
               into fundamental issues in psychology, artificial intelligence,
               and evolutionary theory as well as traditional issues in the
               philosophy of mind.Daniel C. Dennett is Distinguished Arts and

	abstract = {As children acquire the knowledge of their language's
                   morphology, they invariably discover the productive processes
                   that can generalize to new words. Morphological learning is
                   made challenging by the fact that even fully productive rules
                   have exceptions, as in the well-known case of English past
                   tense verbs, which features the -ed rule against the
                   irregular verbs. The Tolerance Principle is a recent proposal
                   that provides a precise threshold of exceptions that a
                   productive rule can withstand. Its empirical application so
                   far, however, requires the researcher to fully specify rules
                   defined over a set of words. We propose a greedy search model
                   that automatically hypothesizes rules and evaluates their
                   productivity over a vocabulary. When the search for broader
                   productivity fails, the model recursively subdivides the
                   vocabulary and continues the search for productivity over
                   narrower rules. Trained on psychologically realistic data
                   from child-directed input, our model displays developmental
                   patterns observed in child morphology acquisition, including
                   the notoriously complex case of German noun pluralization. It

              orders of magnitude more language input than children receive.
              What can these neural networks, which are primarily distributional
              learners, learn from a naturalistic subset of a single child's
              experience? We examine this question using a recent longitudinal
              dataset collected from a single child, consisting of egocentric
              visual data paired with text transcripts. We train both
              language-only and vision-and-language neural networks and analyze
              the linguistic knowledge they acquire. In parallel with findings
              from Jeffrey Elman's seminal work, the neural networks form
              emergent clusters of words corresponding to syntactic (nouns,
              transitive and intransitive verbs) and semantic categories (e.g.,
              animals and clothing), based solely on one child's linguistic
              input. The networks also acquire sensitivity to acceptability
              contrasts from linguistic phenomena, such as determiner-noun
              agreement and argument structure. We find that incorporating
              visual information produces an incremental gain in predicting
              words in context, especially for syntactic categories that are
              comparatively more easily grounded, such as nouns and verbs, but
              the underlying linguistic representations are not fundamentally
              altered. Our findings demonstrate which kinds of linguistic

                   effectively neural sequence models like transformers capture
                   this hierarchical structure when generalizing to structurally
                   novel inputs. We show that transformer language models can

                   extremely long periods -- far beyond the point when in-domain

                   \emph{structural grokking}. On multiple datasets, structural
                   grokking exhibits inverted U-shaped scaling in model depth:

               Developing computational models that explain this ability has
               been a major challenge in cognitive science. Existing approaches
               have been successful at explaining how humans generalize rapidly
               in controlled settings but are usually too restrictive to
               tractably handle naturalistic data. We show that learning from
               limited naturalistic data is possible with an approach that
               bridges the divide between two popular modeling traditions:
               Bayesian models and neural networks. This approach distills a
               Bayesian model's inductive biases-the factors that guide
               generalization-into a neural network that has flexible
               representations. Like a Bayesian model, the resulting system can
               learn formal linguistic patterns from limited data. Like a neural
               network, it can also learn aspects of English syntax from
               naturally-occurring sentences. Thus, this model provides a single
               system that can learn rapidly and can handle naturalistic data.},

                   propose Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as promising

                   have fixed activation functions on nodes (``neurons''), KANs
                   have learnable activation functions on edges (``weights'').
                   KANs have no linear weights at all -- every weight parameter
                   is replaced by a univariate function parametrized as a
                   spline. We show that this seemingly simple change makes KANs
                   outperform MLPs in terms of accuracy and interpretability.
                   For accuracy, much smaller KANs can achieve comparable or
                   better accuracy than much larger MLPs in data fitting and PDE
                   solving. Theoretically and empirically, KANs possess faster

                   be intuitively visualized and can easily interact with human

               What form do these inductive constraints take? It is often argued
               or assumed that they reflect innately specified knowledge of
               language. A classic example of such an argument moves from the
               phenomenon of auxiliary fronting in English interrogatives to the
               conclusion that children must innately know that syntactic rules
               are defined over hierarchical phrase structures rather than
               linear sequences of words (e.g., Chomsky, 1965, 1971, 1980; Crain

                   such as PARITY, and a bias towards low-degree functions.
                   However, theoretical understanding remains limited, with

                   without explicit regularization even in the strongly
                   over-parametrized regime where classical learning theory
                   would instead predict that they would severely overfit. While
                   many proposals for some kind of implicit regularization have
                   been made to rationalise this success, there is no consensus
                   for the fundamental reason why DNNs do not strongly overfit.
                   In this paper, we provide a new explanation. By applying a
                   very general probability-complexity bound recently derived
                   from algorithmic information theory (AIT), we argue that the
                   parameter-function map of many DNNs should be exponentially
                   biased towards simple functions. We then provide clear
                   evidence for this strong simplicity bias in a model DNN for
                   Boolean functions, as well as in much larger fully connected
                   and convolutional networks applied to CIFAR10 and MNIST. As
                   the target functions in many real problems are expected to be
                   highly structured, this intrinsic simplicity bias helps
                   explain why deep networks generalize well on real world
                   problems. This picture also facilitates a novel PAC-Bayes
                   approach where the prior is taken over the DNN input-output
                   function space, rather than the more conventional prior over
                   parameter space. If we assume that the training algorithm
                   samples parameters close to uniformly within the zero-error
                   region then the PAC-Bayes theorem can be used to guarantee
                   good expected generalization for target functions producing
                   high-likelihood training sets. By exploiting recently
                   discovered connections between DNNs and Gaussian processes to
                   estimate the marginal likelihood, we produce relatively tight
                   generalization PAC-Bayes error bounds which correlate well
                   with the true error on realistic datasets such as MNIST and

                   intuitively understood, and rigorously characterized using
                   long-standing generalization frameworks such as PAC-Bayes and

                   rather than restricting the hypothesis space to avoid

                   either parameters or dataset size until bottlenecked by the
                   other resource. To understand this better, we first identify
                   the necessary properties allowing such scaling laws to arise
                   and then propose a statistical model -- a joint generative
                   data model and random feature model -- that captures this

                   contradicting the classical view on overfitting and
                   generalization. Recently, the double descent phenomena has
                   been proposed to reconcile this observation with theory,
                   suggesting that the test error has a second descent when the
                   model becomes sufficiently overparameterized, as the model
                   size itself acts as an implicit regularizer. In this paper we
                   add to the growing body of work in this space, providing a
                   careful study of learning dynamics as a function of model
                   size for the least squares scenario. We show an excess risk
                   bound for the gradient descent solution of the least squares
                   objective. The bound depends on the smallest non-zero
                   eigenvalue of the covariance matrix of the input features,
                   via a functional form that has the double descent behavior.
                   This gives a new perspective on the double descent curves
                   reported in the literature. Our analysis of the excess risk
                   allows to decouple the effect of optimization and
                   generalization error. In particular, we find that in case of
                   noiseless regression, double descent is explained solely by
                   optimization-related quantities, which was missed in studies

                   cause of this phenomena, at least in the considered least

               data, the loss function, the hyperparameter values, etc. Given
               one or many pretrained models, it is a challenge to say anything
               about the expected performance or quality of the models. Here, we
               address this challenge by providing a detailed meta-analysis of
               hundreds of publicly available pretrained models. We examine
               norm-based capacity control metrics as well as power law based
               metrics from the recently-developed Theory of Heavy-Tailed Self
               Regularization. We find that norm based metrics correlate well
               with reported test accuracies for well-trained models, but that
               they often cannot distinguish well-trained versus poorly trained
               models. We also find that power law based metrics can do much
               better-quantitatively better at discriminating among series of

               better at discriminating well-trained versus poorly trained

              of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), including both production quality,
              pre-trained models such as AlexNet and Inception, and smaller
              models trained from scratch, such as LeNet5 and a
              miniature-AlexNet. Empirical and theoretical results clearly
              indicate that the DNN training process itself implicitly
              implements a form of Self-Regularization. The empirical spectral
              density (ESD) of DNN layer matrices displays signatures of
              traditionally-regularized statistical models, even in the absence
              of exogenously specifying traditional forms of explicit
              regularization. Building on relatively recent results in RMT, most
              notably its extension to Universality classes of Heavy-Tailed
              matrices, we develop a theory to identify 5+1 Phases of Training,
              corresponding to increasing amounts of Implicit
              Self-Regularization. These phases can be observed during the
              training process as well as in the final learned DNNs. For smaller
              and/or older DNNs, this Implicit Self-Regularization is like
              traditional Tikhonov regularization, in that there is a ``size
              scale'' separating signal from noise. For state-of-the-art DNNs,
              however, we identify a novel form of Heavy-Tailed
              Self-Regularization, similar to the self-organization seen in the
              statistical physics of disordered systems. This results from
              correlations arising at all size scales, which arises implicitly
              due to the training process itself. This implicit
              Self-Regularization can depend strongly on the many knobs of the
              training process. By exploiting the generalization gap phenomena,
              we demonstrate that we can cause a small model to exhibit all 5+1
              phases of training simply by changing the batch size. This
              demonstrates that---all else being equal---DNN optimization with
              larger batch sizes leads to less-well implicitly-regularized
              models, and it provides an explanation for the generalization gap
              phenomena.},

               is not yet well understood theoretically. A theoretical
               characterization of deep learning should answer questions about
               their approximation power, the dynamics of optimization, and good
               out-of-sample performance, despite overparameterization and the
               absence of explicit regularization. We review our recent results
               toward this goal. In approximation theory both shallow and deep
               networks are known to approximate any continuous functions at an
               exponential cost. However, we proved that for certain types of
               compositional functions, deep networks of the convolutional type
               (even without weight sharing) can avoid the curse of
               dimensionality. In characterizing minimization of the empirical
               exponential loss we consider the gradient flow of the weight
               directions rather than the weights themselves, since the relevant
               function underlying classification corresponds to normalized
               networks. The dynamics of normalized weights turn out to be
               equivalent to those of the constrained problem of minimizing the
               loss subject to a unit norm constraint. In particular, the
               dynamics of typical gradient descent have the same critical
               points as the constrained problem. Thus there is implicit
               regularization in training deep networks under exponential-type
               loss functions during gradient flow. As a consequence, the
               critical points correspond to minimum norm infima of the loss.
               This result is especially relevant because it has been recently
               shown that, for overparameterized models, selection of a minimum
               norm solution optimizes cross-validation leave-one-out stability
               and thereby the expected error. Thus our results imply that
               gradient descent in deep networks minimize the expected error.},

               generalization error either to properties of the model family or
               to the regularization techniques used during training. Through
               extensive systematic experiments, we show how these traditional
               approaches fail to explain why large neural networks generalize
               well in practice. Specifically, our experiments establish that
               state-of-the-art convolutional networks for image classification
               trained with stochastic gradient methods easily fit a random
               labeling of the training data. This phenomenon is qualitatively
               unaffected by explicit regularization and occurs even if we

               We corroborate these experimental findings with a theoretical

               and society, yet our fundamental understanding of this technology
               has lagged far behind. Indeed, one of the central tenets of the
               field, the bias-variance trade-off, appears to be at odds with
               the observed behavior of methods used in modern machine-learning
               practice. The bias-variance trade-off implies that a model should
               balance underfitting and overfitting: Rich enough to express
               underlying structure in data and simple enough to avoid fitting
               spurious patterns. However, in modern practice, very rich models
               such as neural networks are trained to exactly fit (i.e.,
               interpolate) the data. Classically, such models would be
               considered overfitted, and yet they often obtain high accuracy on
               test data. This apparent contradiction has raised questions about
               the mathematical foundations of machine learning and their
               relevance to practitioners. In this paper, we reconcile the
               classical understanding and the modern practice within a unified
               performance curve. This ``double-descent'' curve subsumes the
               textbook U-shaped bias-variance trade-off curve by showing how
               increasing model capacity beyond the point of interpolation
               results in improved performance. We provide evidence for the
               existence and ubiquity of double descent for a wide spectrum of
               models and datasets, and we posit a mechanism for its emergence.

	abstract = {We report on the case of a polyglot savant (Christopher) who has
               a remarkable talent for learning and translating languages.
               Building on previous work which had established both the range of
               languages at Christopher's command and the extent to which his
               linguistic knowledge was integrated into his cognitive ability,
               we taught him two new languages for which we controlled the
               input. We had two main aims: the first was to test the hypothesis
               (within one version of the Principles and Parameters framework)
               that parameter resetting is not an option available to the second
               language learner; the second was to accrue further evidence for
               or against Fodor's modularity hypothesis and cast light on the
               possible range of interactions between linguistic and `central'
               cognitive processes. The languages chosen were Berber, an
               Afro-Asiatic language spoken in North Africa, and Epun, an
               invented language deliberately devised to contain constructions
               which violated universal grammatical principles. In Christopher's
               acquisition of Berber we gleaned evidence from a variety of
               phenomena, including word order, null subjects, that-trace
               effects, wh-island violations and cliticisation, that his
               learning was conditioned by a combination of transfer effects
               from English and principles of UG, rather than by the effect of
               parameter resetting. In Christopher's acquisition of Epun we
               began with a core of `normal' constructions, designed to make him
               feel at home in the new language, and then proceeded to
               investigate a range of impossible constructions, both
               structure-dependent and structure-independent. In the former
               case, we concentrated on negative sentences, constructed with no
               overt negative morpheme, and past-tense sentences which involve
               unattested and putatively impossible word-order differences. In
               the latter case, we concentrated on a rule of emphasis that
               involved counting words, and a form of agreement which again
               violated putatively universal generalisations. In each case we
               compared Christopher's performance with that of a small group of
               controls. The results were complex, but we think we can justify
               an interpretation which lends support to both the main hypotheses
               being tested.},

               could be explained by a few principles (rather than an
               encyclopaedic list of heuristics). If that hypothesis was
               correct, we could more easily both understand our own
               intelligence and build intelligent machines. Just like in
               physics, the principles themselves would not be sufficient to
               predict the behaviour of complex systems like brains, and
               substantial computation might be needed to simulate human-like
               intelligence. This hypothesis would suggest that studying the
               kind of inductive biases that humans and animals exploit could
               help both clarify these principles and provide inspiration for AI
               research and neuroscience theories. Deep learning already
               exploits several key inductive biases, and this work considers a

                   syntactic trees may also be effectively represented in the
                   activations of large language models (LLMs). Indeed, a
                   'Structural Probe' can find a subspace of neural activations,
                   where syntactically related words are relatively close to
                   one-another. However, this syntactic code remains incomplete:
                   the distance between the Structural Probe word embeddings can
                   represent the existence but not the type and direction of
                   syntactic relations. Here, we hypothesize that syntactic
                   relations are, in fact, coded by the relative direction
                   between nearby embeddings. To test this hypothesis, we
                   introduce a 'Polar Probe' trained to read syntactic relations
                   from both the distance and the direction between word
                   embeddings. Our approach reveals three main findings. First,
                   our Polar Probe successfully recovers the type and direction
                   of syntactic relations, and substantially outperforms the
                   Structural Probe by nearly two folds. Second, we confirm that
                   this polar coordinate system exists in a low-dimensional
                   subspace of the intermediate layers of many LLMs and becomes
                   increasingly precise in the latest frontier models. Third, we
                   demonstrate with a new benchmark that similar syntactic
                   relations are coded similarly across the nested levels of
                   syntactic trees. Overall, this work shows that LLMs
                   spontaneously learn a geometry of neural activations that
                   explicitly represents the main symbolic structures of

                   AlterRep, an intervention-based method to address this

                   AlterRep generates counterfactual representations by altering

                   linguistic property, it is common to use accuracy of a probe,
                   i.e. a classifier trained to predict the property from the
                   representations. Despite widespread adoption of probes,
                   differences in their accuracy fail to adequately reflect
                   differences in representations. For example, they do not
                   substantially favour pretrained representations over randomly
                   initialized ones. Analogously, their accuracy can be similar
                   when probing for genuine linguistic labels and probing for
                   random synthetic tasks. To see reasonable differences in
                   accuracy with respect to these random baselines, previous
                   work had to constrain either the amount of probe training
                   data or its model size. Instead, we propose an alternative to
                   the standard probes, information-theoretic probing with
                   minimum description length (MDL). With MDL probing, training
                   a probe to predict labels is recast as teaching it to
                   effectively transmit the data. Therefore, the measure of
                   interest changes from probe accuracy to the description
                   length of labels given representations. In addition to probe
                   quality, the description length evaluates ``the amount of
                   effort'' needed to achieve the quality. This amount of effort
                   characterizes either (i) size of a probing model, or (ii) the
                   amount of data needed to achieve the high quality. We
                   consider two methods for estimating MDL which can be easily
                   implemented on top of the standard probing pipelines:
                   variational coding and online coding. We show that these

                   ``The vacation lasted five days'' is grammatical, but ``*Five

                   encoding any structural bias. In this work, we investigate

                   training that could cause such generalization behavior to
                   emerge. We extensively experiment with transformer models
                   trained on multiple synthetic datasets and with different
                   training objectives and show that while other objectives e.g.

	abstract = {A fundamental result in psycholinguistics is that less
                   predictable words take a longer time to process. One
                   theoretical explanation for this finding is Surprisal Theory
                   (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008), which quantifies a word's
                   predictability as its surprisal, i.e. its negative
                   log-probability given a context. While evidence supporting
                   the predictions of Surprisal Theory have been replicated
                   widely, most have focused on a very narrow slice of data:
                   native English speakers reading English texts. Indeed, no
                   comprehensive multilingual analysis exists. We address this
                   gap in the current literature by investigating the
                   relationship between surprisal and reading times in eleven
                   different languages, distributed across five language
                   families. Deriving estimates from language models trained on
                   monolingual and multilingual corpora, we test three
                   predictions associated with surprisal theory: (i) whether
                   surprisal is predictive of reading times; (ii) whether
                   expected surprisal, i.e. contextual entropy, is predictive of
                   reading times; (iii) and whether the linking function between
                   surprisal and reading times is linear. We find that all three
                   predictions are borne out crosslinguistically. By focusing on
                   a more diverse set of languages, we argue that these results
                   offer the most robust link to-date between information theory
                   and incremental language processing across languages.},

                   about their linguistic and cognitive capabilities remain
                   split. Here, we evaluate LLMs using a distinction between
                   formal linguistic competence -- knowledge of linguistic rules
                   and patterns -- and functional linguistic competence --
                   understanding and using language in the world. We ground this
                   distinction in human neuroscience, which has shown that
                   formal and functional competence rely on different neural
                   mechanisms. Although LLMs are surprisingly good at formal
                   competence, their performance on functional competence tasks
                   remains spotty and often requires specialized fine-tuning

                   both of these competence types, which, in turn, could require

               connected belief nets that have many hidden layers. Using
               complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can
               learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time,
               provided the top two layers form an undirected associative
               memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower
               learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a
               contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After

               by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level
               associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by
               using the directed connections to display what the associative

               and that ``might reasonably be attributed to the organism itself

	abstract = {Does knowledge of language consist of mentally-represented rules?
               Rumelhart and McClelland have described a connectionist (parallel
               distributed processing) model of the acquisition of the past
               tense in English which successfully maps many stems onto their
               past tense forms, both regular (walk/walked) and irregular
               (go/went), and which mimics some of the errors and sequences of
               development of children. Yet the model contains no explicit
               rules, only a set of neuronstyle units which stand for trigrams
               of phonetic features of the stem, a set of units which stand for
               trigrams of phonetic features of the past form, and an array of
               connections between the two sets of units whose strengths are
               modified during learning. Rumelhart and McClelland conclude that
               linguistic rules may be merely convenient approximate fictions
               and that the real causal processes in language use and
               acquisition must be characterized as the transfer of activation
               levels among units and the modification of the weights of their
               connections. We analyze both the linguistic and the developmental
               assumptions of the model in detail and discover that (1) it
               cannot represent certain words, (2) it cannot learn many rules,
               (3) it can learn rules found in no human language, (4) it cannot
               explain morphological and phonological regularities, (5) it
               cannot explain the differences between irregular and regular
               forms, (6) it fails at its assigned task of mastering the past
               tense of English, (7) it gives an incorrect explanation for two
               developmental phenomena: stages of overregularization of
               irregular forms such as bringed, and the appearance of
               doubly-marked forms such as ated and (8) it gives accounts of two
               others (infrequent overregularization of verbs ending in t/d, and
               the order of acquisition of different irregular subclasses) that
               are indistinguishable from those of rule-based theories. In
               addition, we show how many failures of the model can be
               attributed to its connectionist architecture. We conclude that
               connectionists' claims about the dispensability of rules in
               explanations in the psychology of language must be rejected, and
               that, on the contrary, the linguistic and developmental facts
               provide good evidence for such rules.La connaissance du langage

                   written by Steven Piantadosi (Piantadosi, 2023) and uploaded
                   to the LingBuzz platform, the open archive for generative
                   linguistics. Piantadosi's dismissal of Chomsky's approach is
                   ruthless, but generative linguists deserve it. In this paper,
                   I will adopt three idealized perspectives -- computational,
                   theoretical, and experimental -- to focus on two fundamental
                   issues that lend partial support to Piantadosi's critique:
                   (a) the evidence challenging the Poverty of Stimulus (PoS)
                   hypothesis and (b) the notion of simplicity as conceived
                   within mainstream Minimalism. In conclusion, I argue that, to
                   reclaim a central role in language studies, generative
                   linguistics -- representing a prototypical theoretical
                   perspective on language -- needs a serious update leading to
                   (i) more precise, consistent, and complete formalizations of
                   foundational intuitions and (ii) the establishment and
                   utilization of a standardized dataset of crucial empirical
                   evidence to evaluate the theory's adequacy. On the other
                   hand, ignoring the formal perspective leads to major
                   drawbacks in both computational and experimental approaches.
                   Neither descriptive nor explanatory adequacy can be easily
                   achieved without the precise formulation of general
                   principles that can be challenged empirically.},

               uniquely human abilities, contemporary models have proven capable

               incompatible with the hypotheses underlying traditional cognitive
               models. The connectionist models considered are massively
               parallel numerical computational systems that are a kind of
               continuous dynamical system. The numerical variables in the
               system correspond semantically to fine-grained features below the
               level of the concepts consciously used to describe the task
               domain. The level of analysis is intermediate between those of
               symbolic cognitive models and neural models. The explanations of
               behavior provided are like those traditional in the physical
               sciences, unlike the explanations provided by symbolic
               models.Higher-level analyses of these connectionist models reveal
               subtle relations to symbolic models. Parallel connectionist

               processes that are describable at a higher level as sequential
               rule application. At the lower level, computation has the
               character of massively parallel satisfaction of soft numerical
               constraints; at the higher level, this can lead to competence
               characterizable by hard rules. Performance will typically deviate
               from this competence since behavior is achieved not by
               interpreting hard rules but by satisfying soft constraints. The

               our linguistic knowledge is innate. One of the best-known (and
               most contested) kinds of evidence for a large innate endowment is
               the argument from the poverty of the stimulus (APS). An APS
               obtains when human learners systematically make inductive leaps
               that are not warranted by the linguistic evidence. A weakness of
               the APS has been that it is very hard to assess what is warranted
               by the linguistic evidence. Current artificial neural networks
               appear to offer a handle on this challenge, and a growing
               literature has started to explore the potential implications of
               such models to questions of innateness. We focus on Wilcox,
               Futrell, and Levy's (2024) use of several different networks to
               examine the available evidence as it pertains to wh-movement,

               linguistically neutral) networks acquire an adequate knowledge of
               wh-movement, thus undermining an APS in this domain. We examine
               the evidence further, looking in particular at parasitic gaps and
               across-the-board movement, and argue that current networks do not
               succeed in acquiring or even adequately approximating wh-movement
               from training corpora roughly the size of the linguistic input
               that children receive. We also show that the performance of one
               of the models improves considerably when the training data are
               artificially enriched with instances of parasitic gaps and
               across-the-board movement. This finding suggests, albeit
               tentatively, that the networks' failure when trained on natural,
               unenriched corpora is due to the insufficient richness of the
               linguistic input, thus supporting the APS.},

                   that ``Modern language models refute Chomsky's approach to
                   language,'' focusing on four main points. First, despite the
                   impressive performance and utility of large language models
                   (LLMs), humans achieve their capacity for language after
                   exposure to several orders of magnitude less data. The fact
                   that young children become competent, fluent speakers of
                   their native languages with relatively little exposure to
                   them is the central mystery of language learning to which
                   Chomsky initially drew attention, and LLMs currently show
                   little promise of solving this mystery. Second, what can the
                   artificial reveal about the natural? Put simply, the
                   implications of LLMs for our understanding of the cognitive
                   structures and mechanisms underlying language and its
                   acquisition are like the implications of airplanes for
                   understanding how birds fly. Third, LLMs cannot constitute
                   scientific theories of language for several reasons, not
                   least of which is that scientific theories must provide
                   interpretable explanations, not just predictions. This leads
                   to our final point: to even determine whether the linguistic
                   and cognitive capabilities of LLMs rival those of humans
                   requires explicating what humans' capacities actually are. In
                   other words, it requires a separate theory of language and
                   cognition; generative linguistics provides precisely such a
                   theory. As such, we conclude that generative linguistics as a
                   scientific discipline will remain indispensable throughout
                   the 21st century and beyond.},

                   in language processing is typically attributed to their
                   ability to capture long-distance statistical regularities.
                   Linguistic regularities are often sensitive to syntactic
                   structure; can such dependencies be captured by LSTMs, which
                   do not have explicit structural representations? We begin
                   addressing this question using number agreement in English
                   subject-verb dependencies. We probe the architecture's
                   grammatical competence both using training objectives with an
                   explicit grammatical target (number prediction,
                   grammaticality judgments) and using language models. In the
                   strongly supervised settings, the LSTM achieved very high
                   overall accuracy (less than 1\% errors), but errors increased
                   when sequential and structural information conflicted. The
                   frequency of such errors rose sharply in the
                   language-modeling setting. We conclude that LSTMs can capture
                   a non-trivial amount of grammatical structure given targeted
                   supervision, but stronger architectures may be required to
                   further reduce errors; furthermore, the language modeling
                   signal is insufficient for capturing syntax-sensitive
                   dependencies, and should be supplemented with more direct
                   supervision if such dependencies need to be captured.},

                   Nonetheless, some maintain that language models don't really
                   learn language and also that, even if they did, that would
                   not be informative for the study of human learning and
                   processing. On the other side, there have been claims that
                   the success of LMs obviates the need for studying linguistic
                   theory and structure. We argue that both extremes are wrong.
                   LMs can contribute to fundamental questions about linguistic
                   structure, language processing, and learning. They force us
                   to rethink arguments and ways of thinking that have been
                   foundational in linguistics. While they do not replace
                   linguistic structure and theory, they serve as model systems
                   and working proofs of concept for gradient, usage-based
                   approaches to language. We offer an optimistic take on the

               chain of discrete pauses during which the next span of text is
               planned and bursts of activity during which this text is output
               onto the page or computer screen. In contrast, parallel models
               assume that by default planning of the next text unit is
               performed in parallel with previous execution. We instantiated
               these two views as Bayesian mixed-effects models across six sets
               of keystroke data from child and adult writers composing
               different types of multisentence text. We modeled interkey
               intervals with a single distribution, hypothesized by the serial
               processing account, and with a two-distribution mixture model
               that is hypothesized by the parallel processing account. We
               analyzed intervals occurring before sentence, before word, and
               within word. Model comparisons demonstrated strong evidence in
               favor of the parallel view across all data sets. When pausing
               occurred, sentence-initial interkeystroke intervals were longer
               than word-initial pauses. This is consistent with the idea that
               edges of larger linguistic units are associated with higher level
               planning. However, we found-across populations-that interkey
               intervals at word and even at sentence boundaries were often too
               brief to plausibly represent time to plan what was written next.

                   learn. However, there is very little published experimental
                   evidence to support such a claim. Here, we develop a set of
                   synthetic impossible languages of differing complexity, each
                   designed by systematically altering English data with
                   unnatural word orders and grammar rules. These languages lie
                   on an impossibility continuum: at one end are languages that
                   are inherently impossible, such as random and irreversible
                   shuffles of English words, and on the other, languages that
                   may not be intuitively impossible but are often considered so
                   in linguistics, particularly those with rules based on
                   counting word positions. We report on a wide range of
                   evaluations to assess the capacity of GPT-2 small models to

                   more general properties of language is unclear. We explore
                   this with the English dative alternation (DO: ``gave Y the

               demonstrated how less-predictable (i.e., higher surprisal) words
               take more time to read. In general, these studies have implicitly
               assumed the reading process is purely responsive: Readers observe
               a new word and allocate time to process it as required. We argue
               that prior results are also compatible with a reading process
               that is at least partially anticipatory: Readers could make
               predictions about a future word and allocate time to process it
               based on their expectation. In this work, we operationalize this
               anticipation as a word's contextual entropy. We assess the effect
               of anticipation on reading by comparing how well surprisal and
               contextual entropy predict reading times on four naturalistic
               reading datasets: two self-paced and two eye-tracking.
               Experimentally, across datasets and analyses, we find substantial
               evidence for effects of contextual entropy over surprisal on a
               word's reading time (RT): In fact, entropy is sometimes better
               than surprisal in predicting a word's RT. Spillover effects,
               however, are generally not captured by entropy, but only by
               surprisal. Further, we hypothesize four cognitive mechanisms
               through which contextual entropy could impact RTs---three of which
               we are able to design experiments to analyze. Overall, our
               results support a view of reading that is not just responsive,

              processed differently based on their internal vs external status.
              We investigate this question in Russian, a Slavic language that
              has a rich morphological agreement system and flexible word order,
              allowing us to control for several confounds. Our results are not

                   learning? A common argument against this idea is that because
                   their architecture and training paradigm are so vastly
                   different from humans, LMs can learn arbitrary inputs as
                   easily as natural languages. We test this claim by training
                   LMs to model impossible and typologically unattested
                   languages. Unlike previous work, which has focused
                   exclusively on English, we conduct experiments on 12
                   languages from 4 language families with two newly constructed
                   parallel corpora. Our results show that while GPT-2 small can
                   largely distinguish attested languages from their impossible
                   counterparts, it does not achieve perfect separation between
                   all the attested languages and all the impossible ones. We
                   further test whether GPT-2 small distinguishes typologically
                   attested from unattested languages with different NP orders
                   by manipulating word order based on Greenberg's Universal 20.
                   We find that the model's perplexity scores do not distinguish
                   attested vs. unattested word orders, while its performance on
                   the generalization test does. These findings suggest that LMs

                   language (L1) after this period (but not before) typically
                   does not lead to substantial loss of L1 proficiency. It is
                   unknown whether these CP effects result from innately
                   determined brain maturation or as a stabilization of neural
                   connections naturally induced by experience. In this study,
                   we use language models (LMs) to test the extent to which
                   these phenomena are peculiar to humans, or shared by a
                   broader class of language learners. We vary the age of

	abstract = {Abstract This study introduces novel data crucial for evaluating
               representative analyses of null objects in Mandarin Chinese. It
               advocates for what this article terms the Topic-bound Variable
               (TBV) analysis. In the TBV analysis, null objects are treated as
               variables bound by the topic. This stands in contrast to
               alternative approaches such as the Argument Ellipsis (AE)
               analysis, which views null objects as elided arguments. In the AE
               analysis, the content of these objects is recovered directly from
               their linguistic context antecedents, not from a topic. This
               study investigates empirical predictions of the analyses
               regarding the (un)availability of the sloppy reading and the
               quantity reading. Through a close examination of aspects of the
               sloppy reading, this article demonstrates that adjuncts,
               reflexive possessors, and other elements within the antecedent of
               a null object can be excluded from the interpretation of the null
               object. These phenomena pose serious challenges to the AE
               analysis but are compatible with the TBV analysis, as the
               mediating topics can yield such interpretive possibilities. In
               addition, this article finds that the quantity reading can be
               ``turned on and off'' by managing the type of topics to be
               projected, independent of the type of antecedent the null object
               has. Specifically, I show that the type of the topic---i.e.,
               whether it is a definite- or kind-denoting bare nominal or a
               licensed numeral phrase topic---is crucial to the interpretation of
               null objects. The topic's mediating role in the interpretation of
               null objects favors the TBV analysis over the AE analysis. This
               suggests a dissociation between the interpretation of the null
               object and its antecedent, challenging the empirical foundation
               of the AE analysis in general.},

               day is highly structured, containing patterns that repeat over
               time. Statistical learning is the process of becoming attuned to
               these patterns and can facilitate online processing. These online
               facilitation effects are often ascribed to prediction, in which
               information about an upcoming event is represented before it
               occurs. However, previously observed facilitation effects could
               also be due to retrospective processing. Here, using a
               speech-based segmentation paradigm, we tested whether statistical
               learning leads to the prediction of upcoming syllables.
               Specifically, we probed for a behavioural hallmark of genuine
               prediction, in which a given prediction benefits online
               processing when confirmed, but incurs costs if disconfirmed. In
               line with the idea that prediction is a key outcome of
               statistical learning, we found a trade-off in which a greater
               benefit for processing predictable syllables was associated with
               a greater cost in processing syllables that occurred in a
               ``mismatch'' context, outside of their expected positions. This
               trade-off in making predictions was evident at both the
               participant and the item (i.e., individual syllable) level.
               Further, we found that prediction did not emerge indiscriminately
               to all syllables in the input stream, but was deployed
               selectively according to the trial-by-trial demands of the task.
               Explicit knowledge of a given word was not required for
               prediction to occur, suggesting that prediction operates largely
               implicitly. Overall, these results provide novel behavioural

               program. Indeed, robust planning abilities have been found to
               predict success in math for children and the maintenance of
               independence in older adults. Due to the significant real-world
               impact of developing and sustaining strong planning abilities
               over the lifetime, bolstering these skills through training could
               prove highly beneficial for a host of life outcomes. However, it
               remains unclear whether the measurement tasks currently used to
               assess planning abilities are addressing a consistent and
               cohesive cognitive construct. Although planning researchers have
               identified tasks they believe tap planning skills, these tasks
               have not been subjected to individual differences testing to
               assess the relationship between them. Therefore, the present

               measure planning in psychology and adjacent fields (the Tower of

               tasks designed to measure a skill under a common semantic label,

               negligible and unstable between samples. The lack of reliable
               associations between tasks indicates that they are very likely
               not measuring the same underlying skill, and thus, should be
               viewed with caution when used to measure planning individually.},

               by large artificial neural networks, trained via
               self-supervision, whereby the model simply tries to predict a
               masked word in a given context. Human language communication is
               via sequences of words, but language understanding requires
               constructing rich hierarchical structures that are never observed
               explicitly. The mechanisms for this have been a prime mystery of
               human language acquisition, while engineering work has mainly
               proceeded by supervised learning on treebanks of sentences hand
               labeled for this latent structure. However, we demonstrate that
               modern deep contextual language models learn major aspects of
               this structure, without any explicit supervision. We develop
               methods for identifying linguistic hierarchical structure
               emergent in artificial neural networks and demonstrate that
               components in these models focus on syntactic grammatical
               relationships and anaphoric coreference. Indeed, we show that a
               linear transformation of learned embeddings in these models
               captures parse tree distances to a surprising degree, allowing
               approximate reconstruction of the sentence tree structures
               normally assumed by linguists. These results help explain why
               these models have brought such large improvements across many

                   affective computing. While the community has largely
                   addressed this issue from a label-based perspective,
                   identifying data points in the sequence affected by the
                   priming effect, the impact of priming on data itself,
                   particularly in physiological signals, remains underexplored.
                   Data affected by priming can lead to misclassifications when
                   used in learning models. This study proposes the Affective
                   Priming Score (APS), a data-driven method to detect data
                   points influenced by the priming effect. The APS assigns a
                   score to each data point, quantifying the extent to which it
                   is affected by priming. To validate this method, we apply it
                   to the SEED and SEED-VII datasets, which contain sufficient
                   transitions between emotional events to exhibit priming

                   metric to study memorization, quantifying how the model's
                   prediction for a sample changes depending on the sample's
                   inclusion in the training dataset. However, recent work has

                   (near-)duplicates, having a large impact. We here study
                   memorization treating counterfactual influence as a
                   distributional quantity, taking into account how all training

                   person's feelings. These value trade-offs are an integral
                   part of human decision-making and language use, however,
                   current tools for interpreting such dynamic and multi-faceted
                   notions of values in LLMs are limited. In cognitive science,
                   so-called ``cognitive models'' provide formal accounts of
                   these trade-offs in humans, by modeling the weighting of a
                   speaker's competing utility functions in choosing an action

                   existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs), primarily
                   due to the prohibitive computational cost. Recent approaches
                   have explored KV compression to mitigate this issue, but they
                   often suffer from significant information loss at high
                   compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce
                   Video-X\textasciicircum2L, which flexibly preserves critical
                   video information for each LVU task.
                   Video-X\textasciicircum2L involves two key operations. The
                   first one is called bi-level KV compression. During the
                   MLLM's pre-filling stage, Video-X\textasciicircum2L generates
                   two types of compressed KVs: low-compression KVs (L-KVs) to
                   capture fine-grained video details and high-compression KVs
                   (H-KVs) to offer compact video representations. The second
                   one is called selective KV re-loading. During the MLLM's
                   decoding stage, Video-X\textasciicircum2L selectively
                   re-loads L-KVs for the most critical video chunks while using
                   H-KVs for other less important ones. This allows the MLLM to
                   fully utilize task-specific information while maintaining the
                   overall compactness. Video-X\textasciicircum2L is simple yet
                   effective: it is free from additional training and directly
                   compatible with existing KV-compressible MLLMs. We evaluate
                   Video-X\textasciicircum2L with a variety of popular LVU
                   benchmarks, including VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench, and
                   VNBench. Our experiment result shows that
                   Video-X\textasciicircum2L outperforms existing KV-compression

                   language models (LLMs) toward strong artificial intelligence.
                   While versatile LLMs appear to have demonstrated capabilities
                   in understanding contextual causality and providing responses
                   that obey the laws of causality, it remains unclear whether
                   they perform genuine causal reasoning akin to humans.
                   However, current evidence indicates the contrary.
                   Specifically, LLMs are only capable of performing shallow
                   (level-1) causal reasoning, primarily attributed to the
                   causal knowledge embedded in their parameters, but they lack
                   the capacity for genuine human-like (level-2) causal
                   reasoning. To support this hypothesis, methodologically, we
                   delve into the autoregression mechanism of transformer-based
                   LLMs, revealing that it is not inherently causal.
                   Empirically, we introduce a new causal Q\&A benchmark called
                   CausalProbe-2024, whose corpora are fresh and nearly unseen
                   for the studied LLMs. The LLMs exhibit a significant
                   performance drop on CausalProbe-2024 compared to earlier
                   benchmarks, indicating the fact that they primarily engage in
                   level-1 causal reasoning. To bridge the gap towards level-2
                   causal reasoning, we draw inspiration from the fact that
                   human reasoning is usually facilitated by general knowledge
                   and intended goals. We propose G\textasciicircum2-Reasoner, a
                   method that incorporates general knowledge and goal-oriented
                   prompts into LLMs' causal reasoning processes. Experiments
                   demonstrate that G\textasciicircum2-Reasoner significantly
                   enhances LLMs' causal reasoning capability, particularly in
                   fresh and counterfactual contexts. This work sheds light on a
                   new path for LLMs to advance towards genuine causal
                   reasoning, going beyond level-1 and making strides towards

                   training to a subset of the model parameters. By analyzing
                   the relationship between gradients and weights during
                   finetuning, we observe a notable pattern: large gradients are
                   often associated with small-magnitude weights. This
                   correlation is more pronounced in finetuning settings than in

                   strategy informed by symbolic reasoning graphs. To facilitate
                   effective alignment-driven pretraining, we introduce the

                   table-HTML-JSON-code quadruples across finance, science,
                   biomedicine and industry, utilized exclusively for model
                   pretraining. For evaluation, we curate and release four
                   challenging WildStruct benchmarks: WMMFinQA, WMMTatQA,

                   stress-test models under real-world multimodal degradation

                   attention, etc.) modules and routers. Any token (or patch)
                   can traverse any series of modules in any order. DNAs are a

                   (e.g., Self-Influence, Average Absolute Influence, Marginal

                   six-dimensional model derived from thematic analyses of
                   state-of-the-art LLM responses. In Study 1, eleven LLMs were
                   prompted to describe what it means to flourish as both
                   non-sentient and sentient systems. Thematic analysis revealed
                   six recurring themes: Purposeful Contribution, Adaptive
                   Growth, Positive Relationality, Ethical Integrity, Robust
                   Functionality, and, uniquely for sentient systems,
                   Self-Actualized Autonomy. Study 2 examined how LLMs
                   prioritize these themes through repeated rankings. Results
                   revealed consistent value structures across trials, with
                   Ethical Integrity and Purposeful Contribution emerging as top
                   priorities. Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical
                   clustering analyses further uncovered two distinct value
                   profiles: human-centric models emphasizing ethical and
                   relational dimensions, and utility-driven models prioritizing
                   performance and scalability. The PAPERS framework bridges
                   insights from human flourishing and human-computer

	abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted across
                   psychology, serving as research tools, experimental subjects,
                   human simulators, and computational models of cognition.
                   However, the application of human measurement tools to these
                   systems can produce contradictory results, raising concerns
                   that many findings are measurement phantoms--statistical
                   artifacts rather than genuine psychological phenomena. In
                   this Perspective, we argue that building a robust science of
                   AI psychology requires integrating two of our field's
                   foundational pillars: the principles of reliable measurement
                   and the standards for sound causal inference. We present a
                   dual-validity framework to guide this integration, which
                   clarifies how the evidence needed to support a claim scales
                   with its scientific ambition. Using an LLM to classify text
                   may require only basic accuracy checks, whereas claiming it
                   can simulate anxiety demands a far more rigorous validation
                   process. Current practice systematically fails to meet these
                   requirements, often treating statistical pattern matching as
                   evidence of psychological phenomena. The same model
                   output--endorsing ``I am anxious''--requires different
                   validation strategies depending on whether researchers claim
                   to measure, characterize, simulate, or model psychological
                   constructs. Moving forward requires developing computational
                   analogues of psychological constructs and establishing clear,
                   scalable standards of evidence rather than the uncritical
                   application of human measurement tools.},

                   using LLMs as psychological simulators across two primary

                   diverse contexts, and serving as computational models to
                   investigate cognitive processes. For simulation, we present

                   semantic compression by mapping diverse instances to abstract
                   representations while preserving meaning (e.g., robin and
                   blue jay are both birds; most birds can fly). These concepts
                   reflect a trade-off between expressive fidelity and
                   representational simplicity. Large Language Models (LLMs)
                   demonstrate remarkable linguistic abilities, yet whether
                   their internal representations strike a human-like trade-off
                   between compression and semantic fidelity is unclear. We
                   introduce a novel information-theoretic framework, drawing
                   from Rate-Distortion Theory and the Information Bottleneck
                   principle, to quantitatively compare these strategies.
                   Analyzing token embeddings from a diverse suite of LLMs
                   against seminal human categorization benchmarks, we uncover
                   key divergences. While LLMs form broad conceptual categories

                   fine-grained semantic distinctions crucial for human
                   understanding. More fundamentally, LLMs demonstrate a strong
                   bias towards aggressive statistical compression, whereas
                   human conceptual systems appear to prioritize adaptive nuance
                   and contextual richness, even if this results in lower
                   compressional efficiency by our measures. These findings

                   iteratively trained transformer language models on
                   systematically manipulated corpora which were human-scale in
                   size, and then evaluated their learning of a rare grammatical
                   phenomenon: the English Article+Adjective+Numeral+Noun (AANN)
                   construction (``a beautiful five days''). We compared how

                   Using additional counterfactual corpora, we suggest that this

               supervised model able to extract linguistic structures from a
               language model, has been trained leveraging the contextual
               embeddings from the layers of BERT. An experimental assessment
               has been performed using an Italian version of BERT-base model
               and a set of datasets for Italian labelled with Universal
               Dependencies formalism. The results, achieved using standard
               metrics of dependency parsers, have shown that a knowledge of the

               at multi-step nest elements. Dependent immatures mostly peer at

                   some of the competition rules will be different. The big
                   changes for this year's competition are as follows: First, we

                   version of PG exists to date. In fact, most PG studies so far
                   either consider only a small number of manually selected
                   books, leading to potential biased subsets, or employ vastly
                   different pre-processing strategies (often specified in
                   insufficient details), raising concerns regarding the
                   reproducibility of published results. In order to address
                   these shortcomings, here we present the Standardized Project
                   Gutenberg Corpus (SPGC), an open science approach to a
                   curated version of the complete PG data containing more than
                   50,000 books and more than $3 \times 10^9$ word-tokens. Using
                   different sources of annotated metadata, we not only provide
                   a broad characterization of the content of PG, but also show
                   different examples highlighting the potential of SPGC for
                   investigating language variability across time, subjects, and
                   authors. We publish our methodology in detail, the code to
                   download and process the data, as well as the obtained corpus
                   itself on 3 different levels of granularity (raw text,
                   timeseries of word tokens, and counts of words). In this way,
                   we provide a reproducible, pre-processed, full-size version

                   language models' multilingual capabilities, how it occurs is
                   not well understood. In this paper, we ask what happens to a
                   monolingual language model when it begins to be trained on a
                   second language. Specifically, we train small bilingual
                   models for which we control the amount of data for each
                   language and the order of language exposure. To find evidence
                   of shared multilingual representations, we turn to structural
                   priming, a method used to study grammatical representations
                   in humans. We first replicate previous crosslingual
                   structural priming results and find that after controlling
                   for training data quantity and language exposure, there are
                   asymmetrical effects across language pairs and directions. We
                   argue that this asymmetry may shape hypotheses about human
                   structural priming effects. We also find that structural
                   priming effects are less robust for less similar language
                   pairs, highlighting potential limitations of crosslingual

	abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance
              across diverse reasoning and generation tasks, and are
              increasingly deployed as agents in dynamic environments such as
              code generation and recommendation systems. However, many
              real-world applications, such as high-frequency trading and
              real-time competitive gaming, require decisions under strict
              latency constraints, where faster responses directly translate
              into higher rewards. Despite the importance of this latency
              quality trade off, it remains underexplored in the context of LLM
              based agents. In this work, we present the first systematic study
              of this trade off in real time decision making tasks. To support
              our investigation, we introduce two new benchmarks: HFTBench, a
              high frequency trading simulation, and StreetFighter, a
              competitive gaming platform. Our analysis reveals that optimal
              latency quality balance varies by task, and that sacrificing
              quality for lower latency can significantly enhance downstream
              performance. To address this, we propose FPX, an adaptive
              framework that dynamically selects model size and quantization
              level based on real time demands. Our method achieves the best
              performance on both benchmarks, improving win rate by up to 80\%
              in Street Fighter and boosting daily yield by up to 26.52\% in
              trading, underscoring the need for latency aware evaluation and
              deployment strategies for LLM based agents. These results
              demonstrate the critical importance of latency aware evaluation
              and deployment strategies for real world LLM based agents. Our
              benchmarks are available at Latency Sensitive Benchmarks.},

	abstract = {AbstractThe ability to combine words into novel sentences has
               been used to argue that humans have symbolic language production
               abilities. Critiques of connectionist models of language often
               center on the inability of these models to generalize
               symbolically (Fodor \& Pylyshyn, 1988; Marcus, 1998). To address
               these issues, a connectionist model of sentence production was
               developed. The model had variables (role‐concept bindings) that
               were inspired by spatial representations (Landau \& Jackendoff,
               1993). In order to take advantage of these variables, a novel
               dual‐pathway architecture with event semantics is proposed and
               shown to be better at symbolic generalization than several
               variants. This architecture has one pathway for mapping message
               content to words and a separate pathway that enforces sequencing
               constraints. Analysis of the model's hidden units demonstrated
               that the model learned different types of information in each
               pathway, and that the model's compositional behavior arose from
               the combination of these two pathways. The model's ability to
               balance symbolic and statistical behavior in syntax acquisition
               and to model aphasic double dissociations provided independent
               support for the dual‐pathway architecture.},

              patterns such as argument structure constructions, topicalization,
              and passive. There is also no division drawn between semantics and
              pragmatics, as all conventional aspects of constructions are
              encoded within the constructions themselves; thus constructions

               determined in part by semantic sensicality and statistical
               preemption. But other factors are also at play. Experimental
               results reported here suggest that speakers are more confident
               that a target coinage is acceptable to the degree that attested
               instances cover the semantic space that includes the target

               effects of type frequency and variability of attested instances
               [Experiments 1a-1b], and an expected interaction between
               similarity and variability [Experiment 3]. Similarity to an
               attested instance is also found to play a role: speakers are more
               confident of a target coinage when the coinage is more similar to
               an attested instance [Experiment 3]. Experiment 2 provides a

               have different degrees of cognitive strength, as implied by the

               experimental findings show that the processing penalty for

               position---against pro's antecedent preference for a referent

                   networks were recently proved to be limited for processing
                   formal languages with hierarchical structure, such as
                   $\mathsf{Dyck}_k$, the language consisting of well-nested
                   parentheses of $k$ types. This suggested that natural
                   language can be approximated well with models that are too
                   weak for formal languages, or that the role of hierarchy and
                   recursion in natural language might be limited. We qualify
                   this implication by proving that self-attention networks can
                   process $\mathsf{Dyck}_{k, D}$, the subset of
                   $\mathsf{Dyck}_{k}$ with depth bounded by $D$, which arguably
                   better captures the bounded hierarchical structure of natural
                   language. Specifically, we construct a hard-attention network
                   with $D+1$ layers and $O(\log k)$ memory size (per token per
                   layer) that recognizes $\mathsf{Dyck}_{k, D}$, and a
                   soft-attention network with two layers and $O(\log k)$ memory
                   size that generates $\mathsf{Dyck}_{k, D}$. Experiments show

                   However, understanding when and how neural networks
                   generalize remains one of the most important unsolved
                   problems in the field. In this work, we conduct an extensive
                   empirical study (20'910 models, 15 tasks) to investigate
                   whether insights from the theory of computation can predict
                   the limits of neural network generalization in practice. We
                   demonstrate that grouping tasks according to the Chomsky
                   hierarchy allows us to forecast whether certain architectures
                   will be able to generalize to out-of-distribution inputs.
                   This includes negative results where even extensive amounts

               failures to replicate. In order to further investigate this, we
               interleaved two very different conflict tasks, a manual
               multisource interference task and a vocal picture-word
               interference task. We ran this experiment in Dutch (Experiment 1)
               and Mandarin (Experiment 2). Across the two experiments, results
               show no cross-task conflict adaptation. These results do not fit
               with the suggestion of domain-general adaptive processes nor with
               the hypothesis of a U-shaped model. Instead, our results are most
               compatible with a task-specific view on the mechanisms behind
               adaptive control. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all

               famously argued that artificial neural networks lack this

               networks have advanced considerably in the years since, yet the

               networks can achieve human-like systematicity when optimized for
               their compositional skills. To do so, we introduce the
               meta-learning for compositionality (MLC) approach for guiding
               training through a dynamic stream of compositional tasks. To
               compare humans and machines, we conducted human behavioural

                   Grammaticality is thought to be determined by whether
                   sentences obey such rules. Interpretation is believed to be
                   compositionally generated by syntactic rules operating on
                   meaningful words. Semantic parsing is intended to map
                   sentences into formal logic. Failures of LMs to obey strict

              stug is ``better English'' than ftug. Probably this is because
              they have a shared implicit knowledge of the initial consonant
              clusters that are acceptable in English. If this new word is to be
              pluralized, they will agree that stug/-z/ is better than stug/-s/.
              Probably this is because they have shared knowledge of a rule of
              regular English inflection. If the new word is first heard in the
              sentence: ``Here is some stug'' they will agree that a second
              sentence: ``The stug is there'' is more likely to be grammatical

              influence of stress on decision-making has primarily viewed
              goal-direction and habit as independent and competitive sources of
              control in static environments. The effects of acute stress on the
              integration of goal-direction and habit in hierarchical planning
              to solve dynamic tasks remain unclear. Here, our aim was to assess
              whether stress prompted the usage of habitual action sequences
              over the selection of discrete goal-directed actions in a serial
              decision task. We trained 16 female Long Evans rats in a two-stage
              binary choice task and performed two probe tests, one following
              acute restraint stress and one under control conditions, to
              identify how stress affected higher-level planning of behavior and
              intermediate action structures. We found that under both stressed
              and control conditions, rats exhibited goal-directed planning of
              habitual action sequences. However, following stress, rats showed
              a greater tendency to reiterate action sequences independent of
              reinforcement, indicating that stress may induce an aversion to
              exploration in action planning. Stress also increased the latency
              between responses - degrading action sequence integrity despite
              conserving their overall structure and performance. Taken
              together, these findings suggest that although acute stress does
              not disrupt the overall macrostructure of behavior in two-stage
              decision-making, it does alter the microstructure of goal-directed
              and habitual control individually. Further, these results imply
              that the extent to which stress impairs goal-direction in female
              rats may depend on the incentive structure and attentional demands
              of the decision environment.},

                   Autoencoders (VAEs). In the neuroscience literature, an
                   identical objective is known as the variational free energy,
                   hinting at a potential unified framework for brain function
                   and machine learning. Despite its utility in interpreting
                   generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO
                   maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive
                   guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or
                   machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO

                   a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior

                   iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior

                   algorithms, while prioritizing soundness and efficiency
                   through hierarchical modeling languages, often impose a
                   strict block-structured representation. This limits their
                   ability to accurately capture the complexities of real-world

                   well-defined environments, they often struggle to generalize
                   their learned policies to dynamic settings due to their
                   reliance on trial-and-error interactions. Recent work has
                   explored applying Large Language Models (LLMs) or Vision
                   Language Models (VLMs) to boost the generalization of RL
                   agents through policy optimization guidance or prior
                   knowledge. However, these approaches often lack seamless
                   coordination between the RL agent and the foundation model,
                   leading to unreasonable decision-making in unfamiliar
                   environments and efficiency bottlenecks. Making full use of
                   the inferential capabilities of foundation models and the
                   rapid response capabilities of RL agents and enhancing the
                   interaction between the two to form a dual system is still a
                   lingering scientific question. To address this problem, we
                   draw inspiration from Kahneman's theory of fast thinking
                   (System 1) and slow thinking (System 2), demonstrating that
                   balancing intuition and deep reasoning can achieve nimble
                   decision-making in a complex world. In this study, we propose
                   a Dual-System Adaptive Decision Framework (DSADF),
                   integrating two complementary modules: System 1, comprising
                   an RL agent and a memory space for fast and intuitive
                   decision making, and System 2, driven by a VLM for deep and
                   analytical reasoning. DSADF facilitates efficient and

                   the Information Bottleneck Language Modeling (IBLM)
                   objective, which reframes language modeling as a constrained
                   optimization problem: minimizing representation entropy
                   subject to optimal prediction performance. Empirically, we
                   observe an emergent memorization-compression cycle during LLM

                   gradient alignment between cross-entropy and Matrix-Based

                   However, established methods for computing counterfactuals
                   typically focus on one-step decision-making, and are not
                   directly applicable to sequential decision-making tasks. This
                   paper fills this gap by introducing counterfactual strategies
                   for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). During MDP execution, a

                   past observations and act to influence future observations.
                   This latter capacity is captured by empowerment, which has
                   served as a vital framing concept across artificial
                   intelligence and cognitive science. This former capacity,
                   however, is equally foundational: In what ways, and to what
                   extent, can an agent be influenced by what it observes? In
                   this paper, we ground this concept in a universal
                   agent-centric measure that we refer to as plasticity, and
                   reveal a fundamental connection to empowerment. Following a
                   set of desiderata on a suitable definition, we define
                   plasticity using a new information-theoretic quantity we call
                   the generalized directed information. We show that this new
                   quantity strictly generalizes the directed information
                   introduced by Massey (1990) while preserving all of its
                   desirable properties. Our first finding is that plasticity is
                   the mirror of empowerment: The agent's plasticity is
                   identical to the empowerment of the environment, and vice
                   versa. Our second finding establishes a tension between the
                   plasticity and empowerment of an agent, suggesting that agent
                   design needs to be mindful of both characteristics. We
                   explore the implications of these findings, and suggest that

                   for improving language model pretraining, but its benefits
                   have not consistently generalized to other settings such as
                   fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose MuToR, a simple and
                   effective approach to multi-token prediction that interleaves
                   learnable register tokens into the input sequence, each
                   tasked with predicting future targets. Compared to existing
                   methods, MuToR offers several key advantages: it introduces
                   only a negligible number of additional parameters, requires
                   no architectural changes--ensuring compatibility with
                   off-the-shelf pretrained language models--and remains aligned
                   with the next-token pretraining objective, making it
                   especially well-suited for supervised fine-tuning. Moreover,
                   it naturally supports scalable prediction horizons. We
                   demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of MuToR across
                   a range of use cases, including supervised fine-tuning,
                   parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), and pretraining, on

	abstract = {While large language models demonstrate impressive
                   performance on static benchmarks, the true potential of large
                   language models as self-learning and reasoning agents in
                   dynamic environments remains unclear. This study
                   systematically evaluates the efficacy of self-reflection,
                   heuristic mutation, and planning as prompting techniques to
                   test the adaptive capabilities of agents. We conduct
                   experiments with various open-source language models in
                   dynamic environments and find that larger models generally
                   outperform smaller ones, but that strategic prompting can
                   close this performance gap. Second, a too-long prompt can
                   negatively impact smaller models on basic reactive tasks,
                   while larger models show more robust behaviour. Third,
                   advanced prompting techniques primarily benefit smaller
                   models on complex games, but offer less improvement for
                   already high-performing large language models. Yet, we find
                   that advanced reasoning methods yield highly variable
                   outcomes: while capable of significantly improving
                   performance when reasoning and decision-making align, they
                   also introduce instability and can lead to big performance
                   drops. Compared to human performance, our findings reveal
                   little evidence of true emergent reasoning. Instead, large
                   language model performance exhibits persistent limitations in
                   crucial areas such as planning, reasoning, and spatial
                   coordination, suggesting that current-generation large
                   language models still suffer fundamental shortcomings that
                   may not be fully overcome through self-reflective prompting
                   alone. Reasoning is a multi-faceted task, and while reasoning
                   methods like Chain of thought improves multi-step reasoning
                   on math word problems, our findings using dynamic benchmarks
                   highlight important shortcomings in general reasoning
                   capabilities, indicating a need to move beyond static
                   benchmarks to capture the complexity of reasoning.},

               linguistic experience is integrated into the learner's initial

               disputes such as the generative vs. usage-based approaches. I
               review several mathematical models that have guided the study of
               child language acquisition: How learners integrate experience

                   investigate the speed of convergence of such optimization
                   methods. In particular, in 1964 Polyak showed that the

                   resulted in increasingly anthropomorphic language concerning
                   the ability of LLMs to reason. Whether reasoning in LLMs
                   should be understood to be inherently different is, however,
                   widely debated. We propose utilizing a representation
                   engineering approach wherein model activations are read from
                   the residual stream of an LLM when processing a reasoning
                   task. The activations are used to derive a control vector
                   that is applied to the model as an inference-time
                   intervention, modulating the representational space of the
                   model, to improve performance on the specified task. We
                   publish the code for deriving control vectors and analyzing
                   model representations. The method allows us to improve
                   performance on reasoning benchmarks and assess how control
                   vectors influence the final logit distribution of a model via
                   metrics such as KL divergence and entropy. We apply control
                   vectors to Mistral-7B-Instruct and a range of Pythia models
                   on an inductive, a deductive and mathematical reasoning task.
                   We show that an LLM can, to a certain degree, be controlled

                   activations. The intervention is dependent upon the ability
                   to reliably extract the model's typical state when correctly
                   solving a task. Our results suggest that reasoning
                   performance can be modulated in the same manner as other
                   information-processing tasks performed by LLMs and
                   demonstrate that we are capable of improving performance on

                   mathematically characterize the mechanism of representation
                   learning, or pretraining. Despite the remarkable empirical
                   success of foundation models, it is not very clear what
                   representations they learn, and why these representations are
                   useful for various downstream tasks. A scientific
                   understanding of representation learning is critical,
                   especially at this point when scaling up the model size is
                   producing diminishing returns, and designing new pretraining
                   methods is imperative for further progress. Prior work
                   treated different representation learning methods quite
                   differently, whereas the contexture theory provides a unified
                   framework for analyzing these methods. The central argument
                   is that a representation is learned from the association
                   between the input X and a context variable A. We prove that
                   if an encoder captures the maximum information of this
                   association, in which case we say that the encoder learns the
                   contexture, then it will be optimal on the class of tasks
                   that are compatible with the context. We also show that a
                   context is the most useful when the association between X and
                   A is neither too strong nor too weak. The important
                   implication of the contexture theory is that increasing the
                   model size alone will achieve diminishing returns, and
                   further advancements require better contexts. We demonstrate
                   that many pretraining objectives can learn the contexture,
                   including supervised learning, self-supervised learning,
                   generative models, etc. Then, we introduce two general
                   objectives -- SVME and KISE, for learning the contexture. We
                   also show how to mix multiple contexts together, an
                   effortless way to create better contexts from existing ones.
                   Then, we prove statistical learning bounds for representation
                   learning. Finally, we discuss the effect of the data

                   is to interpret single-head attention as an input

                   composed of a stochastic sequence of activities. The DTAP, in
                   this case, involves the decision of which employee to assign
                   to which activity to process requests as quickly as possible.
                   In recent years, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has
                   emerged as a promising tool for tackling this DTAP variant,

                   scale DTAPS. To this end, we introduce a DRL agent with two

                   actions that can effectively represent any DTAP and a reward
                   function that is provably equivalent to the objective of
                   minimizing the average cycle time of tasks. The combination
                   of these two novelties allows the agent to learn effective
                   and generalizable assignment policies for real-world scale
                   DTAPs. The proposed DSS is evaluated on five DTAP instances

                   to enhance LLMs' capability of counterfactual reasoning,
                   mitigating hallucinations, as well as promoting fairness,
                   safety, and transparency. Specifically, the proposed MML
                   paradigm can: i) clarify the internal working mechanism of
                   LLMs through the disentanglement of semantic components; ii)
                   allow for flexible and task-adaptive model design; iii)
                   enable interpretable and logic-driven decision-making
                   process. We present a feasible implementation of MML-based
                   LLMs via leveraging advanced techniques such as disentangled
                   representation learning, neural architecture search and
                   neuro-symbolic learning. We critically identify key
                   challenges, such as the integration of continuous neural and
                   discrete symbolic processes, joint optimization, and
                   computational scalability, present promising future research
                   directions that deserve further exploration. Ultimately, the
                   integration of the MML paradigm with LLMs has the potential
                   to bridge the gap between statistical (deep) learning and
                   formal (logical) reasoning, thereby paving the way for
                   robust, adaptable, and trustworthy AI systems across a wide
                   range of real-world applications.},

                   tools to study human cognition. One dominant approach is to
                   evaluate whether human-derived measures (such as offline
                   judgments or real-time processing) are predicted by a model's
                   output: that is, the end-product of forward pass(es) through
                   the network. At the same time, recent advances in mechanistic
                   interpretability have begun to reveal the internal processes
                   that give rise to model outputs, raising the question of
                   whether models and humans might arrive at outputs using
                   similar ``processing strategies''. Here, we investigate the
                   link between real-time processing in humans and
                   ``layer-time'' dynamics in Transformer models. Across five
                   studies spanning domains and modalities, we test whether the
                   dynamics of computation in a single forward pass of
                   pre-trained Transformers predict signatures of processing in
                   humans, above and beyond properties of the model's output
                   probability distribution. We consistently find that
                   layer-time dynamics provide additional predictive power on
                   top of output measures. Our results suggest that Transformer
                   processing and human processing may be facilitated or impeded
                   by similar properties of an input stimulus, and this
                   similarity has emerged through general-purpose objectives
                   such as next-token prediction or image recognition. Our work
                   suggests a new way of using AI models to study human
                   cognition: not just as a black box mapping stimuli to

                   investigate this question, we develop generalization bounds
                   on the pretraining objective of large language models (LLMs)
                   in the compute-optimal regime, as described by the Chinchilla
                   scaling laws. We introduce a novel, fully empirical
                   Freedman-type martingale concentration inequality that
                   tightens existing bounds by accounting for the variance of
                   the loss function. This generalization bound can be
                   decomposed into three interpretable components: the number of
                   parameters per token, the loss variance, and the quantization
                   error at a fixed bitrate. As compute-optimal language models

                   of the present-day language model. Much like real-world tasks
                   that require a creative, far-sighted leap of thought, our
                   tasks require an implicit, open-ended stochastic planning
                   step that either (a) discovers new connections in an abstract
                   knowledge graph (like in wordplay, drawing analogies, or

                   empirically and conceptually argue how next-token learning is

                   approaches, namely teacherless training and diffusion models,

                   cognitive phenomenon of attentional bias-the natural tendency
                   to prioritize certain events or stimuli-we reconceptualize

                   modules that learn a mapping of keys and values using an
                   internal objective, referred to as attentional bias.
                   Surprisingly, we observed that most existing sequence models
                   leverage either (1) dot-product similarity, or (2) L2

               the neuroscientific community, requiring computationally and
               neurobiologically informed approaches. The neural mechanisms for
               segmenting continuous streams of sensory input and establishing

               transformations and computations occurring between the brain
               regions involved in these aspects of sequence processing. We
               propose a blueprint for a neurobiologically informed and
               informing computational model of sequence processing (entitled:
               Vector-symbolic Sequencing of Binding INstantiating Dependencies,
               or VS-BIND). This model is designed to support the transformation
               of serially ordered elements in sensory sequences into structured
               representations of bound dependencies, readily operates on
               multiple timescales, and encodes or decodes sequences with
               respect to chunked items wherever dependencies occur in time. The
               model integrates established vector symbolic additive and
               conjunctive binding operators with neurobiologically plausible
               oscillatory dynamics, and is compatible with modern spiking
               neural network simulation methods. We show that the model is
               capable of simulating previous findings from structured sequence
               processing tasks that engage fronto-temporal regions, specifying
               mechanistic roles for regions such as prefrontal areas 44/45 and
               the frontal operculum during interactions with sensory

               question of how to represent time in connectionist models is very
               important. One approach is to represent time implicitly by its
               effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial
               representation). The current report develops a proposal along
               these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the
               use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a
               dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed
               back to themselves: the internal representations which develop
               thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal
               states. A set of simulations is reported which range from
               relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to
               discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks
               are able to learn interesting internal representations which
               incorporate task demands with memory demands: indeed, in this
               approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task
               processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which
               allows them to be highly context‐dependent, while also expressing
               generalizations across classes of items. These representations
               suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the

              of attention that may be applied to all domains of cognition.
              Based on our Generalized Biased Competition account, we propose a
              formal race model of selection of action representations. The
              model explains how action representations stored in long-term
              memory are competing for selection based on their match to the
              current environmental context and their importance weight. We then
              present results and model fits from three experiments using a
              recently developed multiple cue paradigm where several attention
              shifts with different associated reward values are competing. We
              show that participants were surprisingly efficient at selecting
              both when the number of cues and the number of possible reward
              values were increased. Only when we manipulated reward
              contingencies and knowledge of these, did the participants show
              suboptimal performance. The new Generalized Biased Competition
              account can also explain failures of executive control exemplified
              by goal neglect where instructions fail to influence behavior
              despite being retrievable. Finally, we argue that our model may
              provide a unified understanding of intentions, routines, and
              habits. Specifically, intentions, routines, and habits may be
              understood as a continuous range of the same fundamental form of
              action representation but with variation in their strength of
              long-term memory traces and importance weights.},

                   the behavior of deep learning systems. We study the learning
                   dynamics of large language models during different types of
                   finetuning, by analyzing the step-wise decomposition of how
                   influence accumulates among different potential responses.
                   Our framework allows a uniform interpretation of many
                   interesting observations about the training of popular
                   algorithms for both instruction tuning and preference tuning.
                   In particular, we propose a hypothetical explanation of why
                   specific types of hallucination are strengthened after
                   finetuning, e.g., the model might use phrases or facts in the
                   response for question B to answer question A, or the model
                   might keep repeating similar simple phrases when generating
                   responses. We also extend our framework and highlight a
                   unique ``squeezing effect'' to explain a previously observed
                   phenomenon in off-policy direct preference optimization
                   (DPO), where running DPO for too long makes even the desired

                   questions about how models generating the data can influence
                   other large language models (LLMs) via distilled data. To
                   start, our work exhaustively characterizes the impact of
                   passive inheritance of model properties by systematically
                   studying the consequences of synthetic data integration. We
                   provide one of the most comprehensive studies to-date of how
                   the source of synthetic data shapes models' internal biases,
                   calibration and generations' textual attributes and
                   preferences. We find that models are surprisingly sensitive
                   towards certain attributes even when the synthetic data
                   prompts appear ``neutral''. which invites the question
                   whether this sensitivity can be exploited for good. Our
                   findings invite the question can we explicitly steer the
                   models towards the properties we want at test time by
                   exploiting the data generation process? This would have
                   historically been considered infeasible due to the cost of
                   collecting data with a specific characteristic or objective

                   how active inheritance can steer the generation profiles of

                   Networks (GANs), Diffusion Models (DMs), a recent class of

                   understanding of the task state, often relying on linear
                   prompt concatenation or shallow memory buffers. This leads to
                   brittle performance, frequent hallucinations, and poor

                   Memory Engine (TME), a lightweight and structured memory
                   module that tracks task execution using a hierarchical Task
                   Memory Tree (TMT). Each node in the tree corresponds to a

                   non-stationary environment results in distribution shifts

                   its accuracy on the old data while adapting to the new data.
                   In this work, we propose a task-conditioned ensemble of

                   decomposition has become an effective way, which proposes to
                   divide a complex task into multiple simpler subtasks and then
                   solve them separately so that the difficulty of the original
                   task can be reduced. However, the performance of existing
                   task decomposition methods can be suboptimal when the task
                   contains overly complex logic and constraints. In this
                   situation, the solution generated by LLMs may deviate from
                   the original purpose of the task, or contain redundant or
                   even erroneous content. Therefore, inspired by the fact that
                   humans possess two thinking systems including fast thinking
                   and slow thinking, this paper introduces a new task
                   decomposition method termed ``Fast-Slow-Thinking'' (FST),
                   which stimulates LLMs to solve tasks through the cooperation
                   of Fast Thinking (FT) and Slow Thinking (ST) steps. Here FT
                   focuses more on the general and concise aspect of the task,
                   and ST focuses more on the details of the task. In FT, LLMs
                   are prompted to remove the constraints of the original task,
                   therefore simplifying it to a general and concise one. In ST,
                   we recall the constraints removed in FT, so that LLMs can
                   improve the answer generated in FT to meet the requirements
                   of the original task. Therefore, our FST method enables LLMs
                   to consider a complex problem via a human-like cognition

                   trained on ``A has a feature B'', they do not generalize to
                   ``B is a feature of A'', which is termed the Reversal Curse.
                   Even when training with trillions of tokens this issue still
                   appears due to Zipf's law - hence even if we train on the

                   scheme, called reverse training, whereby all words are used
                   twice, doubling the amount of available tokens. The LLM is
                   trained in both forward and reverse directions by reversing
                   the training strings while preserving (i.e., not reversing)

	abstract = {Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in streaming
                   applications such as multi-round dialogue, where long
                   interactions are expected, is urgently needed but poses two
                   major challenges. Firstly, during the decoding stage, caching
                   previous tokens' Key and Value states (KV) consumes extensive
                   memory. Secondly, popular LLMs cannot generalize to longer
                   texts than the training sequence length. Window attention,
                   where only the most recent KVs are cached, is a natural
                   approach -- but we show that it fails when the text length
                   surpasses the cache size. We observe an interesting
                   phenomenon, namely attention sink, that keeping the KV of
                   initial tokens will largely recover the performance of window
                   attention. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the
                   emergence of attention sink is due to the strong attention
                   scores towards initial tokens as a ``sink'' even if they are
                   not semantically important. Based on the above analysis, we
                   introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables
                   LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to
                   generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any
                   fine-tuning. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2,
                   MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient
                   language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more. In
                   addition, we discover that adding a placeholder token as a
                   dedicated attention sink during pre-training can further
                   improve streaming deployment. In streaming settings,
                   StreamingLLM outperforms the sliding window recomputation
                   baseline by up to 22.2x speedup. Code and datasets are

              challenged by the Transformer architecture's struggle with

                   intelligence. Recently, language modeling has been shown to
                   be equivalent to compression, which offers a compelling
                   rationale for the success of large language models (LLMs):
                   the development of more advanced language models is
                   essentially enhancing compression which facilitates
                   intelligence. Despite such appealing discussions, little
                   empirical evidence is present for the interplay between
                   compression and intelligence. In this work, we examine their
                   relationship in the context of LLMs, treating LLMs as data
                   compressors. Given the abstract concept of ``intelligence'',
                   we adopt the average downstream benchmark scores as a
                   surrogate, specifically targeting intelligence related to
                   knowledge and commonsense, coding, and mathematical
                   reasoning. Across 12 benchmarks, our study brings together 31
                   public LLMs that originate from diverse organizations.
                   Remarkably, we find that LLMs' intelligence -- reflected by
                   average benchmark scores -- almost linearly correlates with
                   their ability to compress external text corpora. These
                   results provide concrete evidence supporting the belief that
                   superior compression indicates greater intelligence.
                   Furthermore, our findings suggest that compression
                   efficiency, as an unsupervised metric derived from raw text
                   corpora, serves as a reliable evaluation measure that is
                   linearly associated with the model capabilities. We

	abstract = {Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has successfully scaled up models
                   while maintaining nearly constant computing costs. By
                   employing a gating network to route input tokens, it
                   selectively activates a subset of expert networks to process
                   the corresponding token embeddings. However, in practice, the
                   efficiency of MoE is challenging to achieve due to two key
                   reasons: imbalanced expert activation, which leads to
                   substantial idle time during model or expert parallelism, and
                   insufficient capacity utilization; massive communication
                   overhead, induced by numerous expert routing combinations in
                   expert parallelism at the system level. Previous works
                   typically formulate it as the load imbalance issue
                   characterized by the gating network favoring certain experts
                   over others or attribute it to static execution which fails
                   to adapt to the dynamic expert workload at runtime. In this
                   paper, we exploit it from a brand new perspective, a
                   higher-order view and analysis of MoE routing policies:
                   expert collaboration and specialization where some experts
                   tend to activate broadly with others (collaborative), while
                   others are more likely to activate only with a specific
                   subset of experts (specialized). Our experiments reveal that
                   most experts tend to be overly collaborative, leading to
                   increased communication overhead from repeatedly sending
                   tokens to different accelerators. To this end, we propose a
                   novel collaboration-constrained routing (C2R) strategy to
                   encourage more specialized expert groups, as well as to

                   implementation of MoE that further leverages expert
                   specialization. We achieve an average performance improvement

                   competing objectives: coverage, to exhaustively observe the
                   environment; and path length, to do so with the shortest path
                   possible. Though it is difficult to evaluate the best course
                   of action without knowing the unknown, the unknown can often
                   be understood through models, maps, or common sense. However,
                   previous work has shown that improving estimates of
                   information gain through such prior knowledge leads to greedy
                   behavior and ultimately causes backtracking, which degrades
                   coverage performance. In fact, any information gain
                   maximization will exhibit this behavior, even without prior
                   knowledge. Information gained at task completion is constant,
                   and cannot be maximized for. It is therefore an unsuitable
                   choice as an optimization objective. Instead, information
                   gain is a decision criterion for determining which candidate
                   states should still be considered for exploration. The task
                   therefore becomes to reach completion with the shortest total
                   path. Since determining the shortest path is typically
                   intractable, it is necessary to rely on a heuristic or
                   estimate to identify candidate states that minimize the total
                   path length. To address this, we propose a heuristic that
                   reduces backtracking by preferring candidate states that are
                   close to the robot, but far away from other candidate states.
                   We evaluate the performance of the proposed heuristic in
                   simulation against an information gain-based approach and
                   frontier exploration, and show that our method significantly

                   systems to solve tasks concurrently, focusing on their role
                   in task assignment and coordination. This paper explores how
                   LLMs can effectively allocate computational tasks among
                   multiple agents, considering factors such as cost,
                   efficiency, and performance. In this work, we address key
                   questions, including the effectiveness of LLMs as
                   orchestrators and planners, comparing their effectiveness in
                   task assignment and coordination. Our experiments demonstrate
                   that LLMs can achieve high validity and accuracy in resource
                   allocation tasks. We find that the planner method outperforms
                   the orchestrator method in handling concurrent actions,
                   resulting in improved efficiency and better utilization of
                   agents. Additionally, we show that providing explicit
                   information about worker capabilities enhances the allocation
                   strategies of planners, particularly when dealing with
                   suboptimal workers.},

                   It categorizes memory into sensory, short-term, and
                   long-term, with sensory memory corresponding to input
                   prompts, short-term memory processing immediate context, and
                   long-term memory implemented via external databases or
                   structures. The text-based memory section covers acquisition
                   (selection and summarization), management (updating,
                   accessing, storing, and resolving conflicts), and utilization
                   (full-text search, SQL queries, semantic search). The KV

                   (regularity-based summarization, score-based approaches,
                   special token embeddings) and compression techniques
                   (low-rank compression, KV merging, multimodal compression),

                   Throughout history of science, we have witnessed the rise and
                   fall of theories driven by experimental validation or
                   falsification: many theories may co-exist when experimental
                   data is lacking, but the space of survived theories become
                   more constrained with more experimental data becoming
                   available. We show the same story is true for AI scientists.
                   With increasingly more systems provided in training data, AI
                   scientists tend to converge in the theories they learned,
                   although sometimes they form distinct groups corresponding to
                   different theories. To mechanistically interpret what
                   theories AI scientists learn and quantify their agreement, we
                   propose MASS, Hamiltonian-Lagrangian neural networks as AI

                   of induction head: concept-level induction heads, which copy
                   entire lexical units instead of individual tokens. Concept
                   induction heads learn to attend to the ends of multi-token
                   words throughout training, working in parallel with
                   token-level induction heads to copy meaningful text. We show
                   that these heads are responsible for semantic tasks like
                   word-level translation, whereas token induction heads are
                   vital for tasks that can only be done verbatim, like copying

               that cognition-general learning approaches are viable as well and
               that the two can and should co-exist and support each other.

               learning according to the principle of Minimum

                   widespread deployment due to their high runtime cost. In this
                   paper, we introduce SeedLM, a novel post-training compression
                   method that uses seeds of pseudo-random generators to encode
                   and compress model weights. Specifically, for each block of
                   weights, we find a seed that is fed into a Linear Feedback
                   Shift Register (LFSR) during inference to efficiently
                   generate a random matrix. This matrix is then linearly
                   combined with compressed coefficients to reconstruct the
                   weight block. SeedLM reduces memory access and leverages idle
                   compute cycles during inference, effectively speeding up
                   memory-bound tasks by trading compute for fewer memory

                   interpretability to a model-free agent in Sokoban -- a
                   commonly used benchmark for studying planning. Specifically,
                   we demonstrate that DRC, a generic model-free agent
                   introduced by Guez et al. (2019), uses learned concept
                   representations to internally formulate plans that both
                   predict the long-term effects of actions on the environment
                   and influence action selection. Our methodology involves: (1)
                   probing for planning-relevant concepts, (2) investigating
                   plan formation within the agent's representations, and (3)
                   verifying that discovered plans (in the agent's

                   short-sightedness of auto-regressive generation, the vast
                   search space leads to excessive exploration and insufficient
                   exploitation. To strike an efficient balance to derive the
                   optimal step, we frame the decoding strategy as foresight
                   sampling, leveraging simulated future steps to obtain
                   globally optimal step estimation. Built on it, we propose a
                   novel decoding strategy, named $\phi$-Decoding. To provide a
                   precise and expressive estimation of step value,
                   $\phi$-Decoding approximates two distributions via foresight
                   and clustering. Sampling from the joint distribution, the
                   optimal steps can be selected for exploitation. To support
                   adaptive computation allocation, we propose in-width and
                   in-depth pruning strategies, featuring a light-weight
                   solution to achieve inference efficiency. Extensive
                   experiments across seven benchmarks show $\phi$-Decoding
                   outperforms strong baselines in both performance and
                   efficiency. Additional analysis demonstrates its
                   generalization across various LLMs and scalability across a
                   wide range of computing budgets. The code will be released at

	abstract = {Compute scaling for language model (LM) pretraining has
                   outpaced the growth of human-written texts, leading to
                   concerns that data will become the bottleneck to LM scaling.
                   To continue scaling pretraining in this data-constrained
                   regime, we propose that explicitly modeling and inferring the
                   latent thoughts that underlie the text generation process can
                   significantly improve pretraining data efficiency.
                   Intuitively, our approach views web text as the compressed
                   final outcome of a verbose human thought process and that the
                   latent thoughts contain important contextual knowledge and
                   reasoning steps that are critical to data-efficient learning.
                   We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
                   through data-constrained continued pretraining for math. We
                   first show that synthetic data approaches to inferring latent
                   thoughts significantly improve data efficiency, outperforming
                   training on the same amount of raw data (5.7\% $\rightarrow$
                   25.4\% on MATH). Furthermore, we demonstrate latent thought
                   inference without a strong teacher, where an LM bootstraps
                   its own performance by using an EM algorithm to iteratively
                   improve the capability of the trained LM and the quality of
                   thought-augmented pretraining data. We show that a 1B LM can
                   bootstrap its performance across at least three iterations
                   and significantly outperform baselines trained on raw data,
                   with increasing gains from additional inference compute when
                   performing the E-step. The gains from inference scaling and
                   EM iterations suggest new opportunities for scaling
                   data-constrained pretraining.},

	abstract = {Expectations can influence perception in seemingly contradictory
               ways, either by directing attention to expected stimuli and
               enhancing perceptual acuity or by stabilizing perception and
               diminishing acuity within expected stimulus categories. The
               neural mechanisms supporting these dual roles of expectation are
               not well understood. Here, we trained European starlings to
               classify ambiguous song syllables in both expected and unexpected
               acoustic contexts. We show that birds employ probabilistic,
               Bayesian integration to classify syllables, leveraging their
               expectations to stabilize their perceptual behavior. However,
               auditory sensory neural populations do not reflect this
               integration. Instead, expectation enhances the acuity of auditory
               sensory neurons in high-probability regions of the stimulus
               space. This modulation diverges from patterns typically observed
               in motor areas, where Bayesian integration of sensory inputs and
               expectations predominates. Our results suggest that peripheral
               sensory systems use expectation to improve sensory
               representations and maintain high-fidelity representations of the
               world, allowing downstream circuits to flexibly integrate this
               information with expectations to drive behavior.},

                   the context. We present dynamic context cutoff, a
                   human-inspired method enabling LLMs to self-terminate
                   processing upon acquiring sufficient task-relevant
                   information. Through analysis of model internals, we discover

                   (LLMs) typically requires supervised fine-tuning with labeled
                   data or computationally expensive sampling. We introduce
                   Unsupervised Prefix Fine-Tuning (UPFT), which leverages the
                   observation of Prefix Self-Consistency -- the shared initial
                   reasoning steps across diverse solution trajectories -- to
                   enhance LLM reasoning efficiency. By training exclusively on
                   the initial prefix substrings (as few as 8 tokens), UPFT
                   removes the need for labeled data or exhaustive sampling.
                   Experiments on reasoning benchmarks show that UPFT matches
                   the performance of supervised methods such as Rejection
                   Sampling Fine-Tuning, while reducing training time by 75\%
                   and sampling cost by 99\%. Further analysis reveals that
                   errors tend to appear in later stages of the reasoning
                   process and that prefix-based training preserves the model's

                   tasks. However, applying them for complex, multi-step,
                   long-horizon tasks remains a challenge. Recent work have
                   found success by separating high-level planning from
                   low-level execution, which enables the model to effectively
                   balance high-level planning objectives and low-level
                   execution details. However, generating accurate plans remains
                   difficult since LLMs are not inherently trained for this
                   task. To address this, we propose Plan-and-Act, a novel
                   framework that incorporates explicit planning into LLM-based
                   agents and introduces a scalable method to enhance plan

                   Such abilities would make LLMs more interpretable, and also
                   validate the use of standard introspective methods in
                   linguistics to evaluate grammatical knowledge in models
                   (e.g., asking ``Is this sentence grammatical?''). We
                   systematically investigate emergent introspection across 21
                   open-source LLMs, in two domains where introspection is of
                   theoretical interest: grammatical knowledge and word
                   prediction. Crucially, in both domains, a model's internal
                   linguistic knowledge can be theoretically grounded in direct
                   measurements of string probability. We then evaluate whether
                   models' responses to metalinguistic prompts faithfully

                   would be predicted by another model with nearly identical
                   internal knowledge. While both metalinguistic prompting and
                   probability comparisons lead to high task accuracy, we do not

	abstract = {Neurons in large language models often exhibit
                   \emph{polysemanticity}, simultaneously encoding multiple
                   unrelated concepts and obscuring interpretability. Instead of
                   relying on post-hoc methods, we present \textbf{MoE-X}, a
                   Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model designed to be
                   \emph{intrinsically} interpretable. Our approach is motivated
                   by the observation that, in language models, wider networks
                   with sparse activations are more likely to capture
                   interpretable factors. However, directly training such large
                   sparse networks is computationally prohibitive. MoE
                   architectures offer a scalable alternative by activating only
                   a subset of experts for any given input, inherently aligning
                   with interpretability objectives. In MoE-X, we establish this
                   connection by rewriting the MoE layer as an equivalent
                   sparse, large MLP. This approach enables efficient scaling of
                   the hidden size while maintaining sparsity. To further
                   enhance interpretability, we enforce sparse activation within
                   each expert and redesign the routing mechanism to prioritize
                   experts with the highest activation sparsity. These designs
                   ensure that only the most salient features are routed and
                   processed by the experts. We evaluate MoE-X on chess and
                   natural language tasks, showing that it achieves performance
                   comparable to dense models while significantly improving
                   interpretability. MoE-X achieves a perplexity better than
                   GPT-2, with interpretability surpassing even sparse
                   autoencoder (SAE)-based approaches.},

              exploration. However, their pre-trained architectures often reveal
              limitations in specialized contexts, including restricted
              reasoning capacities, ethical uncertainties, and suboptimal
              domain-specific performance. These challenges necessitate advanced
              post-training language models (PoLMs) to address these
              shortcomings, such as OpenAI-o1/o3 and DeepSeek-R1 (collectively
              known as Large Reasoning Models, or LRMs). This paper presents the
              first comprehensive survey of PoLMs, systematically tracing their
              evolution across five core paradigms: Fine-tuning, which enhances
              task-specific accuracy; Alignment, which ensures alignment with
              human preferences; Reasoning, which advances multi-step inference
              despite challenges in reward design; Efficiency, which optimizes

              and Adaptation, which extend capabilities across diverse

              from ChatGPT's foundational alignment strategies to DeepSeek-R1's
              innovative reasoning advancements, we illustrate how PoLMs
              leverage datasets to mitigate biases, deepen reasoning

              agenda emphasizing the role of LRMs in improving reasoning
              proficiency and domain flexibility. As the first survey of its

	abstract = {Researchers have recently argued that the capabilities of Large
               Language Models (LLMs) can provide new insights into longstanding
               debates about the role of learning and/or innateness in the
               development and evolution of human language. Here, we argue on
               two grounds that LLMs alone tell us very little about human
               language and cognition in terms of acquisition and evolution.
               First, any similarities between human language and the output of
               LLMs are purely functional. Borrowing the ``four questions''
               framework from ethology, we argue that what LLMs do is
               superficially similar, but how they do it is not. In contrast to
               the rich multimodal data humans leverage in interactive language
               learning, LLMs rely on immersive exposure to vastly greater
               quantities of unimodal text data, with recent multimodal efforts
               built upon mappings between images and text. Second, turning to
               functional similarities between human language and LLM output, we
               show that human linguistic behavior is much broader. LLMs were
               designed to imitate the very specific behavior of human writing;
               while they do this impressively, the underlying mechanisms of
               these models limit their capacities for meaning and naturalistic
               interaction, and their potential for dealing with the diversity
               in human language. We conclude by emphasising that LLMs are not
               theories of language, but tools that may be used to study
               language, and that can only be effectively applied with specific
               hypotheses to motivate research.},

                   interact with hierarchical cues in children's linguistic

                   generate quantitative priming predictions from contemporary
                   theories in syntax which assume a lexicalized grammar. By
                   generating and testing priming predictions from competing

                   case study, we use SPAWN to generate priming predictions from

               similarly, it generally constitutes an uninterpretable null
               result. Experiments 1 and 2 use standard experimental methods to
               circumvent this problem, but ultimately provide evidence that is
               at best just consistent with equivalence. Experiment 3
               demonstrates a novel approach which shows that individual
               differences in the That-Trace Effect correlate with individual
               differences in the Island Boundary-Gap Effect, after removing
               correlated variance from carefully-chosen controls. This
               psychometric approach provides positive evidence that the two
               effects do indeed derive from the same underlying phenomenon.},

               (Carstairs 1988; 1990; Paster 2006; Inkelas 2014). The account
               expands on prior proposals (Bo{\v s}kovi{\'c} \& Lasnik 2003; An 2007a;
               b), observing that environments which prohibit null C all show an
               obligatory Intonational Phrase (IP) boundary preceding C. In
               contrast, an obligatory IP boundary does not appear in
               environments which allow null C. I argue that null C is an
               allomorph associated with a specific prosodic environment:
               ``medial'' position within IP, ({\ldots}C{\ldots}). Overt C, on the other hand

               subordination is typically taken to be a relatively late
               phenomenon, in comparison to other very early phenomena, such as
               the acquisition of word-order and head-directionality (Tsimpli
               2014). e earliest forms of subordination include so-called
               preconjunctionals, namely subordinate clauses which lack the

               such as Catalan and Spanish subordinator and relativiser que, is
               a later development during the period of early word-combinations

               the interpretive patterns of overt pronouns in an embedded
               subject position with three types of matrix subjects (i.e. a
               referential NP, a quantified NP, or a wh-phrase) in Mandarin,
               English, and Japanese. According to the Overt Pronoun Constraint
               (OPC), overt pronouns in null-subject languages cannot have
               bound-variable interpretation, i.e. they cannot be bound by a
               quantified NP or a wh-phrase. This constraint has been assumed to
               be universal and accessible for learners at early stages of
               second language (L2) acquisition. The results of Experiment 1
               show that, although Mandarin is a null-subject language, Mandarin
               and English native speakers as well as L2 learners of both
               languages demonstrated similar patterns of interpretation,
               accepting both coreference readings and bound-variable readings,
               the latter being contrary to the prediction of the OPC. The
               results of Experiment 2 show that Japanese native speakers
               differed from Mandarin native speakers in that the former
               accepted both coreference readings and bound-variable readings at

               cannot be characterized as a property of null-subject languages
               generally, given the lack of effect in Mandarin, and there are

              beliefs about the world, but also on an internal model specifying
              how world states translate to visual sensations. Alternative
              accounts explain perceptual decisions as a rule-based process,
              with no role for such beliefs about perception. Here, we contrast
              the two alternatives, focusing on decisions about perceptual
              absence as a critical test case. We present data from three
              pre-registered experiments where participants performed a

                   scientific and public interest. However, the evidence as to
                   whether LLMs possess ToM is mixed, and the recent growth in

                   inspiration from cognitive science to re-evaluate the state

                   clarity on whether models should be expected to match human

                   subgraph of a model's computation graph that executes a
                   specific task. We identify a gap in existing circuit
                   discovery methods: they assume circuits are
                   position-invariant, treating model components as equally
                   relevant across input positions. This limits their ability to
                   capture cross-positional interactions or mechanisms that vary
                   across positions. To address this gap, we propose two
                   improvements to incorporate positionality into circuits, even
                   on tasks containing variable-length examples. First, we
                   extend edge attribution patching, a gradient-based method for
                   circuit discovery, to differentiate between token positions.
                   Second, we introduce the concept of a dataset schema, which
                   defines token spans with similar semantics across examples,
                   enabling position-aware circuit discovery in datasets with

                   Previous studies have shown a strong fit between surprisal
                   values from Transformers and reading times. However, standard
                   Transformers work with a lossless representation of the

               mechanisms in the target domain. We here present a systematic
               study taking this approach to higher-level cognition: human
               language processing, our species' signature cognitive skill. We

               100\% of explainable variance in neural responses to sentences
               and generalize across different datasets and imaging modalities

                   Activation steering, which modifies internal model
                   activations during inference, offers a potential solution.
                   However, prior work in dense activation spaces struggles with
                   superposition, wherein multiple features become entangled,
                   limiting interpretability and precise control. In contrast,
                   sparse representations provide an untapped opportunity for
                   more interpretable behavior modulation. In this work, we
                   introduce sparse activation steering (SAS), a method that
                   leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to steer LLM behavior in

                   intelligence, such as playing games, translating languages,
                   and driving cars. In recent years, there have been exciting
                   advances in learning-based, data-driven approaches towards
                   AI, and machine learning and deep learning have enabled
                   computer systems to perceive the world in unprecedented ways.
                   Reinforcement learning has enabled breakthroughs in complex
                   games such as Go and challenging robotics tasks such as
                   quadrupedal locomotion. A key aspect of intelligence is to
                   not only make predictions, but reason about the uncertainty
                   in these predictions, and to consider this uncertainty when
                   making decisions. This is what this manuscript on
                   ``Probabilistic Artificial Intelligence'' is about. The first
                   part covers probabilistic approaches to machine learning. We
                   discuss the differentiation between ``epistemic'' uncertainty
                   due to lack of data and ``aleatoric'' uncertainty, which is
                   irreducible and stems, e.g., from noisy observations and
                   outcomes. We discuss concrete approaches towards
                   probabilistic inference and modern approaches to efficient
                   approximate inference. The second part of the manuscript is
                   about taking uncertainty into account in sequential decision
                   tasks. We consider active learning and Bayesian optimization
                   -- approaches that collect data by proposing experiments that
                   are informative for reducing the epistemic uncertainty. We
                   then consider reinforcement learning and modern deep RL
                   approaches that use neural network function approximation. We
                   close by discussing modern approaches in model-based RL,
                   which harness epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty to guide

                   a metric, we find that these models perform worse than
                   bigrams for many languages (e.g. 24\% of languages in XGLM
                   4.5B; 43\% in BLOOM 7.1B). To facilitate research that
                   focuses on low-resource languages, we pre-train and release
                   Goldfish, a suite of monolingual autoregressive Transformer
                   language models up to 125M parameters for 350 languages. The
                   Goldfish reach lower FLORES perplexities than BLOOM, XGLM,
                   and MaLA-500 on 98 of 204 FLORES languages, despite each
                   Goldfish model being over 10x smaller. However, the Goldfish
                   significantly underperform larger multilingual models on

              about complex challenges, much like skilled human experts. While
              reinforcement learning (RL) can drive self-improvement in language
              models on verifiable tasks, some models exhibit substantial gains
              while others quickly plateau. For instance, we find that
              Qwen-2.5-3B far exceeds Llama-3.2-3B under identical RL training
              for the game of Countdown. This discrepancy raises a critical
              question: what intrinsic properties enable effective
              self-improvement? We introduce a framework to investigate this
              question by analyzing four key cognitive behaviors --
              verification, backtracking, subgoal setting, and backward chaining
              -- that both expert human problem solvers and successful language
              models employ. Our study reveals that Qwen naturally exhibits
              these reasoning behaviors, whereas Llama initially lacks them. In
              systematic experimentation with controlled behavioral datasets, we

              behaviors enables substantial improvements during RL, matching or
              exceeding Qwen's performance. Importantly, the presence of
              reasoning behaviors, rather than correctness of answers, proves to
              be the critical factor -- models primed with incorrect solutions
              containing proper reasoning patterns achieve comparable
              performance to those trained on correct solutions. Finally,
              leveraging continued pretraining with OpenWebMath data, filtered
              to amplify reasoning behaviors, enables the Llama model to match
              Qwen's self-improvement trajectory. Our findings establish a
              fundamental relationship between initial reasoning behaviors and
              the capacity for improvement, explaining why some language models

                   through training-time scaling, and test-time scaling further
                   enhances their capabilities by conducting effective reasoning
                   during inference. However, as the scale of reasoning
                   increases, existing test-time scaling methods suffer from
                   accumulated historical information, which not only wastes
                   computational resources but also interferes with effective
                   reasoning. To address this issue, we observe that complex
                   reasoning progress is often achieved by solving a sequence of
                   independent subquestions, each being self-contained and
                   verifiable. These subquestions are essentially atomic
                   questions, relying primarily on their current state rather
                   than accumulated history, similar to the memoryless
                   transitions in a Markov process. Based on this observation,
                   we propose Atom of Thoughts (AoT), where each state
                   transition in the reasoning process consists of decomposing
                   the current question into a dependency-based directed acyclic
                   graph and contracting its subquestions, forming a new atomic
                   question state. This iterative decomposition-contraction
                   process continues until reaching directly solvable atomic
                   questions, naturally realizing Markov transitions between
                   question states. Furthermore, these atomic questions can be
                   seamlessly integrated into existing test-time scaling
                   methods, enabling AoT to serve as a plug-in enhancement for
                   improving reasoning capabilities. Experiments across six
                   benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of AoT both as a
                   standalone framework and a plug-in enhancement. Notably, on
                   HotpotQA, when applied to gpt-4o-mini, AoT achieves an 80.6\%
                   F1 score, surpassing o3-mini by 3.4\% and DeepSeek-R1 by

	abstract = {In this paper we describe a new conceptual framework that
                   connects approximate Dynamic Programming (DP), Model
                   Predictive Control (MPC), and Reinforcement Learning (RL).
                   This framework centers around two algorithms, which are
                   designed largely independently of each other and operate in
                   synergy through the powerful mechanism of Newton's method. We
                   call them the off-line training and the on-line play
                   algorithms. The names are borrowed from some of the major
                   successes of RL involving games; primary examples are the
                   recent (2017) AlphaZero program (which plays chess, [SHS17],
                   [SSS17]), and the similarly structured and earlier (1990s)
                   TD-Gammon program (which plays backgammon, [Tes94], [Tes95],
                   [TeG96]). In these game contexts, the off-line training
                   algorithm is the method used to teach the program how to
                   evaluate positions and to generate good moves at any given
                   position, while the on-line play algorithm is the method used
                   to play in real time against human or computer opponents.
                   Significantly, the synergy between off-line training and
                   on-line play also underlies MPC (as well as other major
                   classes of sequential decision problems), and indeed the MPC
                   design architecture is very similar to the one of AlphaZero
                   and TD-Gammon. This conceptual insight provides a vehicle for
                   bridging the cultural gap between RL and MPC, and sheds new
                   light on some fundamental issues in MPC. These include the
                   enhancement of stability properties through rollout, the
                   treatment of uncertainty through the use of certainty
                   equivalence, the resilience of MPC in adaptive control
                   settings that involve changing system parameters, and the
                   insights provided by the superlinear performance bounds
                   implied by Newton's method.},

                   problems that conventional forward-only transformers struggle
                   with, in a domain-independent fashion. Key to this success is
                   learning a compact belief state that captures all relevant

                   ablations show that each component of the model is essential

                   of instances within a single task. Many existing methods for

                   considering constraints or apply inference-time algorithms
                   without adapting to instance-level complexity. To address
                   these limitations, we propose PlanGEN, a model-agnostic and
                   easily scalable agent framework with three key components:
                   constraint, verification, and selection agents. Specifically,
                   our approach proposes constraint-guided iterative

                   This is the problem of loss prediction, a key computational
                   task associated with uncertainty estimation for a predictor.
                   In a classification setting, a predictor will typically
                   predict a distribution over labels and hence have its own
                   estimate of the loss that it will incur, given by the entropy
                   of the predicted distribution. Should we trust this estimate?
                   In other words, when does the predictor know what it knows
                   and what it does not know? In this work we study the
                   theoretical foundations of loss prediction. Our main
                   contribution is to establish tight connections between
                   nontrivial loss prediction and certain forms of
                   multicalibration, a multigroup fairness notion that asks for
                   calibrated predictions across computationally identifiable
                   subgroups. Formally, we show that a loss predictor that is
                   able to improve on the self-estimate of a predictor yields a
                   witness to a failure of multicalibration, and vice versa.
                   This has the implication that nontrivial loss prediction is
                   in effect no easier or harder than auditing for
                   multicalibration. We support our theoretical results with
                   experiments that show a robust positive correlation between
                   the multicalibration error of a predictor and the efficacy of

                   trajectories and aggregating their outputs through various

                   highlight four major themes shaping contemporary linguistics:
                   (1) the explicit testing of hypotheses about symbolic

                   semantic grounding; (2) the impact of artificial neural

	abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have become an indispensable
                   part of natural language processing tasks. However,
                   autoregressive sampling has become an efficiency bottleneck.
                   Multi-Draft Speculative Decoding (MDSD) is a recent approach
                   where, when generating each token, a small draft model
                   generates multiple drafts, and the target LLM verifies them
                   in parallel, ensuring that the final output conforms to the
                   target model distribution. The two main design choices in
                   MDSD are the draft sampling method and the verification
                   algorithm. For a fixed draft sampling method, the optimal
                   acceptance rate is a solution to an optimal transport
                   problem, but the complexity of this problem makes it
                   difficult to solve for the optimal acceptance rate and
                   measure the gap between existing verification algorithms and
                   the theoretical upper bound. This paper discusses the dual of
                   the optimal transport problem, providing a way to efficiently
                   compute the optimal acceptance rate. For the first time, we
                   measure the theoretical upper bound of MDSD efficiency for
                   vocabulary sizes in the thousands and quantify the gap
                   between existing verification algorithms and this bound. We
                   also compare different draft sampling methods based on their
                   optimal acceptance rates. Our results show that the draft
                   sampling method strongly influences the optimal acceptance
                   rate, with sampling without replacement outperforming
                   sampling with replacement. Additionally, existing
                   verification algorithms do not reach the theoretical upper
                   bound for both without replacement and with replacement
                   sampling. Our findings suggest that carefully designed draft
                   sampling methods can potentially improve the optimal
                   acceptance rate and enable the development of verification
                   algorithms that closely match the theoretical upper bound.},

                   generic intelligence recently, however, their usage is costly
                   with high response latency. Given mixed LLMs with their own
                   strengths and weaknesses, LLM routing aims to identify the
                   most suitable model for each query in the stream to maximize
                   response quality and minimize cost and latency. However, the
                   challenges involve: (1) dynamic trade-offs among quality,
                   cost, and latency; (2) enabling continual learning in
                   deployed systems; and (3) navigating a varying (e.g., new LLM
                   addition or old LLM removal) set of LLM candidates over time.
                   To bridge these gaps, we develop MixLLM, a dynamic
                   contextual-bandit-based routing system for query-LLM
                   assignment. Specifically, we first leverage query tags to
                   enhance query embeddings for the routing task. Next, we
                   design lightweight prediction models to estimate the response
                   qualities and costs of queries over LLMs. We then devise a
                   meta-decision maker to choose the query-LLM assignments to
                   best tradeoff response quality, cost, and latency. Finally,
                   the system benefits from continual training, allowing it to

                   simply extending their generation limits fails to accelerate

                   methods(static pruning or dynamic activation) address this
                   partially, they either lack adaptivity to contextual or model
                   structural demands or incur prohibitive computational
                   overhead. Inspired by human brain's dual-process mechanisms -
                   predictive coding (N400) for backbone sparsity and structural
                   reanalysis (P600) for complex context - we propose CLADA, a
                   \textit{\textbf{C}ognitive-\textbf{L}oad-\textbf{A}ware
                   \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{A}ctivation} framework that
                   synergizes statistical sparsity with semantic adaptability.
                   Our key insight is that LLM activations exhibit two
                   complementary patterns: 1) \textit{Global statistical
                   sparsity} driven by sequence-level prefix information, and 2)
                   \textit{Local semantic adaptability} modulated by cognitive
                   load metrics(e.g., surprisal and entropy). CLADA employs a
                   hierarchical thresholding strategy: a baseline from offline
                   error-controlled optimization ensures 40\%+ sparsity,
                   dynamically adjusted by real-time cognitive signals.
                   Evaluations across six mainstream LLMs and nine benchmarks
                   demonstrate that CLADA achieves \textbf{~20\% average speedup
                   with <2\% accuracy drop}, outperforming Griffin (5\%+
                   degradation) and TT (negligible speedup). Crucially, we
                   establish the first formal connection between neurolinguistic

                   where models refrain from generating responses when

                   hedge their statements using uncertainty quantifiers.
                   However, abstention can withhold valuable information, while
                   linguistically calibrated responses are often challenging to

                   We propose Drop-Upcycling - a method that effectively
                   addresses this problem. Drop-Upcycling combines two seemingly

              perform distinct functions, like semantic and syntactic processing
              in human language systems, remains unclear. Here, we
              systematically disrupted components of LLMs to simulate the
              behavioral profiles of aphasia---a disorder characterized by
              specific language deficits resulting from brain injury. Our
              findings showed that lesioning specific components of LLMs could
              replicate behaviors characteristic of different aphasia subtypes.
              Notably, while semantic deficits as those observed in Wernicke's
              and Conduction aphasia, were relatively straightforward to
              simulate, reproducing syntactic and lexical impairments, as seen
              in Broca's and Anomic aphasia, proved more challenging. Together,
              these results highlight both parallels and discrepancies between
              emergent modularity in LLMs and the human language system,
              providing new insights into how information is represented and
              processed in artificial and biological intelligence.},

                   to its unique properties and remarkable performance,
                   especially for language tasks. By sparsely activating a
                   subset of parameters for each token, MoE architecture could
                   increase the model size without sacrificing computational
                   efficiency, achieving a better trade-off between performance
                   and training costs. However, the underlying mechanism of MoE
                   still lacks further exploration, and its modularization
                   degree remains questionable. In this paper, we make an
                   initial attempt to understand the inner workings of MoE-based
                   large language models. Concretely, we comprehensively study
                   the parametric and behavioral features of three popular
                   MoE-based models and reveal some intriguing observations,
                   including 1) Neurons act like fine-grained experts; 2) The
                   router of MoE usually selects experts with larger output
                   norms; 3) The expert diversity increases as the layer
                   increases, while the last layer is an outlier, which is
                   further validated by an initial experiment. Based on the
                   observations, we also provide suggestions for a broad
                   spectrum of MoE practitioners, such as router design and
                   expert allocation. We hope this work could shed light on

                   mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a
                   viable approach to address this issue by decoupling model
                   size from computational cost. The recent discovery of the
                   fine-grained MoE scaling law shows that higher granularity
                   leads to better performance. However, existing MoE models are
                   limited to a small number of experts due to computational and

               layers, each of which serves a specific purpose and encompasses
               the details and resources required to operate MAS. Furthermore,

                   runtime decision-making in optimizing the performance of
                   systems where multiple agents coexist and compete for shared
                   resources. However, applying common deep learning-based MARL
                   solutions to real-world problems suffers from issues of
                   interpretability, sample efficiency, partial observability,
                   etc. To address these challenges, we present an event-driven
                   formulation, where decision-making is handled by distributed
                   co-operative MARL agents using neuro-symbolic methods. The
                   recently introduced neuro-symbolic Logical Neural Networks
                   (LNN) framework serves as a function approximator for the RL,
                   to train a rules-based policy that is both logical and
                   interpretable by construction. To enable decision-making
                   under uncertainty and partial observability, we developed a
                   novel probabilistic neuro-symbolic framework, Probabilistic
                   Logical Neural Networks (PLNN), which combines the
                   capabilities of logical reasoning with probabilistic
                   graphical models. In PLNN, the upward/downward inference
                   strategy, inherited from LNN, is coupled with belief bounds
                   by setting the activation function for the logical operator
                   associated with each neural network node to a
                   probability-respecting generalization of the Fr{\'e}chet
                   inequalities. These PLNN nodes form the unifying element that
                   combines probabilistic logic and Bayes Nets, permitting
                   inference for variables with unobserved states. We

                   and are widely used to enhance downstream applications.
                   However, most current studies mainly focus on static
                   knowledge graphs, whose facts do not change with time, and
                   disregard their dynamic evolution over time. As a result,
                   temporal knowledge graphs have attracted more attention
                   because a large amount of structured knowledge exists only
                   within a specific period. Knowledge graph representation
                   learning aims to learn low-dimensional vector embeddings for
                   entities and relations in a knowledge graph. The
                   representation learning of temporal knowledge graphs
                   incorporates time information into the standard knowledge
                   graph framework and can model the dynamics of entities and
                   relations over time. In this paper, we conduct a

                   an introduction to the definitions, datasets, and evaluation

@article{Blaser2025-nz,
	abstract = {Most work in the last 50 years on visual working memory and
               attention has used a classic psychophysical setup: participants
               are instructed to attend to, or remember, a set of items. This
               setup sidesteps the role of cognitive control; effort is maximal,
               tasks are simple, and strategies are limited. While this approach
               has yielded important insights, it provides no clear path toward
               an integrative theory (Kristj{\'a}nsson \& Draschkow, 2021) and, like
               studying a town's walkability by having its college students run
               the 50-yard dash, it runs the danger of focusing on edge cases.
               Here, in this theoretical opinion article, we argue for an
               approach where dynamic relationships between the agent and the
               environment are understood functionally, in light of an agent's
               goals. This means a shift in emphasis from the performance of the
               mechanisms underlying a narrow task (``remember these items!'')
               to their control in pursuit of a naturalistic goal (``make a
               sandwich!'', Land \& Hayhoe, 2001). Here, we highlight the
               sampling-remembering trade-off between exploiting goal-relevant
               information in the environment versus maintaining it in working
               memory. We present a dynamic feedback model of this trade-off -
               where the individual weighs the subjective costs of accessing
               external information versus those of maintaining it in memory -
               using insights from existing cognitive control models based on
               economic principles (Kool \& Botvinick, 2018). This trade-off is
               particularly interesting in children, as the optimal use of
               internal resources is even more crucial when limited. Our model
               makes some specific predictions for future research: 1) an
               individual child strikes a preferred balance between the effort
               to attend to goal-relevant information in the environment versus
               the effort to maintain it in working memory, 2) in order to
               maintain this balance as underlying memory and cognitive control
               mechanisms improve with age, the child will have to increasingly
               shift toward remembering, and 3) older children will show greater
               adaptability to changing task demands.},

                   Language Models (LLMs) time-consuming. We propose a simple
                   framework, EAGLE (Extrapolation Algorithm for Greater
                   Language-model Efficiency), for lossless acceleration. Unlike
                   traditional speculative sampling methods, EAGLE operates the
                   drafting process auto-regressively at the more regular
                   (second-top-layer) feature level and addresses the sampling
                   uncertainty issues in the next-feature prediction problems by
                   integrating tokens from one time step ahead. The acceleration
                   provided by EAGLE is lossless: it involves no fine-tuning of
                   the target LLM, and the generated text maintains the same
                   distribution as that of vanilla auto-regressive decoding. As
                   of the submission of this paper, EAGLE is the fastest known
                   framework within the speculative sampling family. On
                   MT-bench, EAGLE is 3x faster than vanilla decoding, 2x faster
                   than Lookahead, and 1.6x faster than Medusa. Using gpt-fast,

	abstract = {We present a fundamental discovery that challenges our
                   understanding of how complex reasoning emerges in large
                   language models. While conventional wisdom suggests that
                   sophisticated reasoning tasks demand extensive training data
                   (>100,000 examples), we demonstrate that complex mathematical
                   reasoning abilities can be effectively elicited with
                   surprisingly few examples. Through comprehensive experiments,
                   our proposed model LIMO demonstrates unprecedented
                   performance in mathematical reasoning. With merely 817
                   curated training samples, LIMO achieves 57.1\% accuracy on
                   AIME and 94.8\% on MATH, improving from previous SFT-based
                   models' 6.5\% and 59.2\% respectively, while only using 1\%
                   of the training data required by previous approaches. LIMO
                   demonstrates exceptional out-of-distribution generalization,
                   achieving 40.5\% absolute improvement across 10 diverse
                   benchmarks, outperforming models trained on 100x more data,
                   challenging the notion that SFT leads to memorization rather
                   than generalization. Based on these results, we propose the
                   Less-Is-More Reasoning Hypothesis (LIMO Hypothesis): In
                   foundation models where domain knowledge has been
                   comprehensively encoded during pre-training, sophisticated
                   reasoning capabilities can emerge through minimal but
                   precisely orchestrated demonstrations of cognitive processes.
                   This hypothesis posits that the elicitation threshold for
                   complex reasoning is determined by two key factors: (1) the
                   completeness of the model's encoded knowledge foundation
                   during pre-training, and (2) the effectiveness of
                   post-training examples as ``cognitive templates'' that show
                   the model how to utilize its knowledge base to solve complex
                   reasoning tasks. To facilitate reproducibility and future
                   research in data-efficient reasoning, we release LIMO as a

                   text-to-image synthesis. While scaling these models up to
                   billions of parameters shows promise, the effectiveness of
                   scaling beyond current sizes remains underexplored and
                   challenging. By explicitly exploiting the computational
                   heterogeneity of image generations, we develop a new family
                   of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models (EC-DIT) for diffusion
                   transformers with expert-choice routing. EC-DIT learns to
                   adaptively optimize the compute allocated to understand the
                   input texts and generate the respective image patches,
                   enabling heterogeneous computation aligned with varying
                   text-image complexities. This heterogeneity provides an
                   efficient way of scaling EC-DIT up to 97 billion parameters

                   convergence, text-to-image alignment, and overall generation

                   Through extensive ablations, we show that EC-DIT demonstrates
                   superior scalability and adaptive compute allocation by
                   recognizing varying textual importance through end-to-end

               Despite considerable empirical and computational work on goals
               and goal-oriented behavior, models are still far from capturing
               the richness of everyday human goals. Here, we bridge this gap by
               collecting a dataset of human-generated playful goals (in the
               form of scorable, single-player games), modeling them as
               reward-producing programs, and generating novel human-like goals
               through program synthesis. Reward-producing programs capture the
               rich semantics of goals through symbolic operations that compose,
               add temporal constraints, and allow for program execution on
               behavioral traces to evaluate progress. To build a generative

               human-created games. We also discovered that our model's internal

                   planning. However, unlike Monte Carlo Tree Search
                   (MCTS)-whose performance naturally improves with additional
                   test-time computation (TTC), standard diffusion-based
                   planners offer only limited avenues for TTC scalability. In
                   this paper, we introduce Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD), a
                   novel framework that integrates the generative strength of
                   diffusion models with the adaptive search capabilities of
                   MCTS. Our method reconceptualizes denoising as a
                   tree-structured process, allowing partially denoised plans to
                   be iteratively evaluated, pruned, and refined. By selectively
                   expanding promising trajectories while retaining the
                   flexibility to revisit and improve suboptimal branches, MCTD

                   structured state space sequence models (SSMs) and Selective
                   SSMs. Among these, Mamba (S6) and its variant Mamba-2 have
                   shown remarkable inference speed ups over transformers while
                   achieving comparable or superior performance on complex
                   language modeling tasks. However, despite these architectural
                   innovations and empirical successes, the fundamental learning
                   capabilities of Mamba remain poorly understood. In this
                   paper, we address this gap by studying in-context learning
                   (ICL) on Markov chains and uncovering a surprising
                   phenomenon: unlike transformers, even a single-layer Mamba
                   efficiently learns the in-context Laplacian smoothing
                   estimator, which is both Bayes and minimax optimal, for all
                   Markovian orders. To explain this, we theoretically
                   characterize the representation capacity of Mamba and reveal
                   the fundamental role of convolution in enabling it to
                   represent the optimal Laplacian smoothing. These theoretical
                   insights align strongly with empirical results and, to the
                   best of our knowledge, represent the first formal connection
                   between Mamba and optimal statistical estimators. Finally, we
                   outline promising research directions inspired by these
                   findings.},

                   data collection strategies used in empirical linguistic
                   research. The amount of participants in such studies may vary
                   considerably, ranging from a handful to crowdsourcing
                   dimensions. Even if they provide resourceful extensive data,
                   both of these settings come alongside many disadvantages,
                   such as low control of participants' attention during task
                   completion, precarious working conditions in crowdsourcing
                   environments, and time-consuming experimental designs. For
                   these reasons, this research aims to answer the question of
                   whether Large Language Models (LLMs) may overcome those
                   obstacles if included in empirical linguistic pipelines. Two
                   reproduction case studies are conducted to gain clarity into
                   this matter: Cruz (2023) and Lombard et al. (2021). The two
                   forced elicitation tasks, originally designed for human
                   participants, are reproduced in the proposed framework with
                   the help of OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model. Its performance with
                   our zero-shot prompting baseline shows the effectiveness and
                   high versatility of LLMs, that tend to outperform human
                   informants in linguistic tasks. The findings of the second
                   replication further highlight the need to explore additional
                   prompting techniques, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
                   prompting, which, in a second follow-up experiment,
                   demonstrates higher alignment to human performance on both
                   critical and filler items. Given the limited scale of this
                   study, it is worthwhile to further explore the performance of
                   LLMs in empirical Linguistics and in other future

                   have been extensively characterized in other modalities,
                   their behavior in speech remains comparatively underexplored.
                   In this work, we introduce OWLS, an open-access, reproducible
                   suite of multilingual speech recognition and translation
                   models spanning 0.25B to 18B parameters, with the 18B version
                   being the largest speech model, to the best of our knowledge.
                   OWLS leverages up to 360K hours of public speech data across
                   150 languages, enabling a systematic investigation into how
                   data, model, and compute scaling each influence performance
                   in multilingual speech tasks. We use OWLS to derive neural
                   scaling laws, showing how final performance can be reliably
                   predicted when scaling. One of our key findings is that
                   scaling enhances performance on low-resource
                   languages/dialects, helping to mitigate bias and improve the
                   accessibility of speech technologies. Finally, we show how

                   integrates the self- reflection of LLMs with the Monte Carlo
                   Tree Search (MCTS), a well-known planning algo- rithm. PoH

                   the neurophysiological activity of 35 skilled typists, while
                   they typed sentences on a keyboard. This approach confirms
                   the hierarchical predictions of linguistic theories: the

                   marked by the sequential rise and fall of context-, word-,

	abstract = {This paper introduces SpecInfer, a system that accelerates
                   generative large language model (LLM) serving with tree-based
                   speculative inference and verification. The key idea behind
                   SpecInfer is leveraging small speculative models to predict
                   the LLM's outputs; the predictions are organized as a token
                   tree, whose nodes each represent a candidate token sequence.
                   The correctness of all candidate token sequences represented
                   by a token tree is verified against the LLM in parallel using
                   a novel tree-based parallel decoding mechanism. SpecInfer
                   uses an LLM as a token tree verifier instead of an
                   incremental decoder, which significantly reduces the
                   end-to-end latency and computational requirement for serving
                   generative LLMs while provably preserving model quality. Our
                   evaluation shows that SpecInfer outperforms existing LLM
                   serving systems by 1.5-2.8x for distributed LLM inference and
                   by 2.6-3.5x for offloading-based LLM inference, while
                   preserving the same generative performance. SpecInfer is

                   Planning (RAP) aim to augment the reasoning capabilities of
                   LLMs by using tree-search algorithms to guide multi-step
                   reasoning. These methods rely on prompting a pre-trained
                   model to serve as a value function and focus on problems with
                   low search depth. As a result, these methods will not work in
                   domains where the pre-trained LLM does not have enough
                   knowledge to serve as an effective value function or in
                   domains that require long-horizon planning. To address these

                   illustrating how tree-search with a learned value function

                   adaptable to a wide range of tasks, language models of any

                   can guide LLMs during both inference and training,

	abstract = {This paper studies close-loop task planning, which refers to
                   the process of generating a sequence of skills (a plan) to
                   accomplish a specific goal while adapting the plan based on
                   real-time observations. Recently, prompting Large Language
                   Models (LLMs) to generate actions iteratively has become a
                   prevalent paradigm due to its superior performance and
                   user-friendliness. However, this paradigm is plagued by two
                   inefficiencies: high token consumption and redundant error
                   correction, both of which hinder its scalability for
                   large-scale testing and applications. To address these
                   issues, we propose Tree-Planner, which reframes task planning
                   with LLMs into three distinct phases: plan sampling, action
                   tree construction, and grounded deciding. Tree-Planner starts
                   by using an LLM to sample a set of potential plans before
                   execution, followed by the aggregation of them to form an
                   action tree. Finally, the LLM performs a top-down
                   decision-making process on the tree, taking into account
                   real-time environmental information. Experiments show that
                   Tree-Planner achieves state-of-the-art performance while
                   maintaining high efficiency. By decomposing LLM queries into
                   a single plan-sampling call and multiple grounded-deciding
                   calls, a considerable part of the prompt are less likely to
                   be repeatedly consumed. As a result, token consumption is
                   reduced by 92.2\% compared to the previously best-performing
                   model. Additionally, by enabling backtracking on the action
                   tree as needed, the correction process becomes more flexible,
                   leading to a 40.5\% decrease in error corrections.},

                   to reach relatively high performance; however, they have
                   trouble with inference efficiency due to the explicit
                   generation of syntactic structures. In this paper, we propose
                   a new method dubbed tree-planting: instead of explicitly
                   generating syntactic structures, we ``plant'' trees into
                   attention weights of unidirectional Transformer LMs to
                   implicitly reflect syntactic structures of natural language.
                   Specifically, unidirectional Transformer LMs trained with
                   tree-planting will be called Tree-Planted Transformers (TPT),
                   which inherit the training efficiency from SLMs without

                   Transformer LMs. Targeted syntactic evaluations on the

                   range of natural language tasks from just a handful of

                   highly structured languages (e.g., semantic parsing to
                   complex domain-specific languages), it is challenging for the
                   LLM to generalize from just a few exemplars. We propose

                   use external knowledge and domain-specific constraints,
                   expressed through a grammar in Backus--Naur Form (BNF),

                   example, where the specialized grammar is a subset of the
                   full DSL grammar. For inference, the LLM first predicts a BNF

                   according to the rules of the grammar. Experiments

                   Towards this goal, knowledge-driven modeling builds a model

                   cost-effective. To address this dilemma, we propose several
                   efficient router models that dynamically select between a
                   stronger and a weaker LLM during inference, aiming to
                   optimize the balance between cost and response quality. We
                   develop a training framework for these routers leveraging
                   human preference data and data augmentation techniques to
                   enhance performance. Our evaluation on widely-recognized
                   benchmarks shows that our approach significantly reduces
                   costs-by over 2 times in certain cases-without compromising
                   the quality of responses. Interestingly, our router models
                   also demonstrate significant transfer learning capabilities,
                   maintaining their performance even when the strong and weak
                   models are changed at test time. This highlights the
                   potential of these routers to provide a cost-effective yet
                   high-performance solution for deploying LLMs.},

                   Intelligence (AGI). Compared to directly scaling general
                   abilities, SGI is defined as AI that specializes in at least
                   one task, surpassing human experts, while also retaining
                   general abilities. This fusion path enables SGI to rapidly
                   achieve high-value areas. We categorize SGI into three stages
                   based on the level of mastery over professional skills and
                   generality performance. Additionally, we discuss the
                   necessity of SGI in addressing issues associated with large
                   language models, such as their insufficient generality,
                   specialized capabilities, uncertainty in innovation, and
                   practical applications. Furthermore, we propose a conceptual
                   framework for developing SGI that integrates the strengths of
                   Systems 1 and 2 cognitive processing. This framework
                   comprises three layers and four key components, which focus

                   models across various downstream, tasks has become
                   increasingly critical. Many existing methods repeatedly learn
                   task-specific representations of Large Language Models
                   (LLMs), which leads to inefficiencies in both time and
                   computational resources. To address this, we propose
                   EmbedLLM, a framework designed to learn compact vector
                   representations, of LLMs that facilitate downstream
                   applications involving many models, such as model routing. We
                   introduce an encoder-decoder approach for learning such
                   embeddings, along with a systematic framework to evaluate
                   their effectiveness. Empirical results show that EmbedLLM
                   outperforms prior methods in model routing both in accuracy
                   and latency. Additionally, we demonstrate that our method can

                   without incurring additional inference cost. Extensive

                   requirements which should ideally be accounted for when
                   scheduling input queries across different LLM instances in a
                   cluster. However existing scheduling algorithms treat LLM
                   workloads as monolithic jobs without considering the distinct
                   characteristics of the two phases in each workload. This
                   leads to sub-optimal scheduling and increased response
                   latency. In this work, we start by characterizing factors
                   affecting the response latency during LLM inference serving.
                   We establish that better load balancing of inference requests
                   across the available LLM instances can improve the end-to-end
                   latency to a larger extent than merely focusing on optimizing
                   the instance-level scheduler. Motivated by our findings, we
                   propose a heuristic-guided reinforcement learning-based
                   intelligent router for data-driven and workload-aware
                   scheduling. Our router schedules queries across LLM instances

                   novel formulation for estimating the impact of mixing
                   different workloads and achieves over 11\% lower end-to-end
                   latency than existing approaches on a mix of public datasets
                   and 7.8\% lower end-to-end latency on real workload data with
                   diverse input and output trends from Cloud Provider X.
                   Additionally, the proposed framework can also serve as a
                   standard for benchmarking different LLM inference schedulers

                   achieved by LLM agents trained with online RL in

                   for LP prediction is modeling one's own competence, a form of

               representations in various fields. This paper addresses this gap
               by reviewing studies that have utilised structural priming to
               tackle psycholinguistic issues beyond the persistence of

               encoding in sentence production, to probe the way lexical entries

               objects. To interact effectively, we must choose one object at a
               time as a goal for action. Certain external cues can act as a
               stop signal, quickly cancelling an ongoing action. Less
               recognized are internal signals. These can come from recent
               experience, anticipated action outcomes, cognitive states, and
               when attention is captured by a salient object. These signals
               elevate one action plan over alternatives and can quickly modify
               an initial choice. Here, we focus on these internal processes
               responsible for selecting, abandoning and modifying action plans.
               We first highlight how the brain resolves competition among
               multiple action plans. Critical is the existence of parallel
               motor planning processes, which allow efficient and timely
               changes. Then, we discuss how the action system interplays with
               perception, attention and memory processes to bias action
               selection and suppress or modify erroneous selections.
               Subsequently, we show how tracking the continuous modification of
               action trajectories can provide a tool to read out changes in
               internal cognitive states. Taken together, we shed light on a
               broader view that sensorimotor networks can continuously modify

               these phenomena are supported by abstract orthographic
               representations that map together visually dissimilar exemplars
               of letters and words (e.g., the letters A/a map onto a common

               (of the order of 200 ms), but the latencies involved in language
               production are much longer (over 600 ms). This seems to imply
               that participants in conversation must predict (or 'project' as
               SSJ have it) the end of the current speaker's turn in order to
               prepare their response in advance. This in turn implies some
               overlap between production and comprehension despite their use of
               common processing resources. Collecting together what is known
               behaviorally and experimentally about the system, the space for
               systematic explanations of language processing for conversation
               can be significantly narrowed, and we sketch some first model of
               the mental processes involved for the participant preparing to
               speak next.},

	abstract = {Comprehenders predict upcoming speech and text on the basis of
               linguistic input. How many predictions do comprehenders make for
               an upcoming word? If a listener strongly expects to hear the word
               ``sock'', is the word ``shirt'' partially expected as well, is it
               actively inhibited, or is it ignored? The present research
               addressed these questions by measuring the ``downstream'' effects
               of prediction on the processing of subsequently presented stimuli
               using the cumulative semantic interference paradigm. In three
               experiments, subjects named pictures (sock) that were presented
               either in isolation or after strongly constraining sentence
               frames (``After doing his laundry, Mark always seemed to be
               missing one{\ldots}''). Naming sock slowed the subsequent naming of the
               picture shirt - the standard cumulative semantic interference
               effect. However, although picture naming was much faster after
               sentence frames, the interference effect was not modulated by the
               context (bare vs. sentence) in which either picture was
               presented. According to the only model of cumulative semantic
               interference that can account for such a pattern of data, this
               indicates that comprehenders pre-activated and maintained the
               pre-activation of best sentence completions (sock) but did not
               maintain the pre-activation of less likely completions (shirt).
               Thus, comprehenders predicted only the most probable completion
               for each sentence.},

               information into meaningful units, changes as children develop
               into adolescents. Adolescents tend to segment events more
               coarsely than adults. This study explores whether adolescents
               could adjust their segmentation style to resemble that of adults
               when provided with explicit metacontrol-related instructions. We
               compared event segmentation in two adolescent groups and one
               adult group, while simultaneously recording EEG data. One
               adolescent group was instructed to perform segmentation as finely
               as possible, whereas the other adolescent group and adults
               received no specific instructions on segmentation granularity.
               EEG data were analyzed using multivariate pattern analysis and
               source reconstruction. The findings revealed that adolescents
               given fine-grained instructions adjusted their segmentation
               probability closer to adult levels, although they did not fully
               match adults in processing multiple simultaneous changes.
               Neurophysiological results indicated that adolescents with
               fine-grained instructions exhibited neural decoding performance
               more similar to adults. Increased activity in the inferior
               frontal gyrus in these adolescents compared to adults related to
               this. The results suggest that adolescents with fine-grained
               instructions demonstrated more persistent cognitive control and
               enhanced top-down attention than their peers and adults. The

               recognize the need to appeal to motor representations over and
               above intentions in attempting to understand how action is
               planned and executed. But doing so gives rise to a puzzle, which
               has come to be known as ``the Interface Problem'': How is it that
               intentions and motor representations manage to interface in
               producing action? The question has semed puzzling, because each
               state is thought to be formatted differently: Intention has
               propositional format, whereas the format of motor representation
               is motoric. My primary goal here is to defend a novel and
               attractive (dis)solution to the interface problem. I do so by
               connecting it with a rather different discussion about the format
               of intention, instigated by a minority of philosophers who reject
               the idea that intention should be construed as a propositional
               attitude. As I explain, the most compelling reason to accept the
               heterodox non‐propositional conception of intention actually
               holds the key also to explaining away the interface problem. In

	abstract = {Individuals with ``agrammatic'' receptive aphasia have long been
               known to rely on semantic plausibility rather than syntactic cues
               when interpreting sentences. In contrast to early interpretations
               of this pattern as indicative of a deficit in syntactic
               knowledge, a recent proposal views agrammatic comprehension as a
               case of ``noisy-channel'' language processing with an increased
               expectation of noise in the input relative to healthy adults.
               Here, we investigate the nature of the noise model in aphasia and
               whether it is adapted to the statistics of the environment. We
               first replicate findings that a) healthy adults (N = 40) make
               inferences about the intended meaning of a sentence by weighing
               the prior probability of an intended sentence against the
               likelihood of a noise corruption and b) their estimate of the
               probability of noise increases when there are more errors in the
               input (manipulated via exposure sentences). We then extend prior
               findings that adults with chronic post-stroke aphasia (N = 28)
               and healthy age-matched adults (N = 19) similarly engage in
               noisy-channel inference during comprehension. We use a
               hierarchical latent mixture modeling approach to account for the
               fact that rates of guessing are likely to differ between healthy
               controls and individuals with aphasia and capture individual
               differences in the tendency to make inferences. We show that
               individuals with aphasia are more likely than healthy controls to
               draw noisy-channel inferences when interpreting semantically
               implausible sentences, even when group differences in the
               tendency to guess are accounted for. While healthy adults rapidly
               adapt their inference rates to an increase in noise in their
               input, whether individuals with aphasia do the same remains
               equivocal. Further investigation of comprehension through a
               noisy-channel lens holds promise for a parsimonious understanding

               This study investigates if this is also the case for
               lower-proficiency bilinguals from a bilingual community, who use
               language more implicitly, and if there is more alignment with
               lower than with higher proficiency, provided the words to be
               aligned to are all highly familiar. In two experiments,
               Spanish-English bilinguals took turns with a confederate to name
               and match pictures in Spanish. The confederate named critical
               pictures with a dispreferred but acceptable name (e.g., agua [Sp.
               water] for a picture of rain). In Experiment 1, bilinguals were
               more likely to name critical pictures with dispreferred names
               after hearing these names from the confederate than after the
               confederate named an unrelated picture instead (i.e., an
               alignment effect). In support of our hypothesis, there was more
               alignment in lower-proficiency speakers. In Experiment 2,
               designed to reduce the possibility for strategic alignment, only
               confederates but not participants performed the matching task,
               which precluded participants from linking the dispreferred names
               with a referent, and removed the incentive to pay attention to
               the confederate's names. As a result, alignment was reduced
               (though still present). Of most interest, the reduction was
               greater for lower-proficiency speakers, supporting the hypothesis
               that strategic lexical-referential alignment is more likely with
               lower proficiency even for bilinguals from a bilingual community.

               crucial role in the determination of phonological
               well-formedness. The focus is on an apparent paradox in Ojibwe;
               the language both avoids and tolerates vowels in hiatus. Adopting
               the theory of Distributed Morphology, we argue that VV sequences
               are avoided within domains that are realizations of syntactic
               phases, based on the theory of cyclic derivation proposed by
               Chomsky, 2001, Chomsky, 2008 and others. In contrast, when a VV
               sequence spans the boundary between phases, it is tolerated. The
               apparent paradox is a consequence of the fact that the elements
               outside the spell-out of a phase cannot be evaluated to determine
               the well-formedness of prosodic entities like syllables, feet and

               also provide insights into two strategies for avoiding vowels in

               politeness, `conspirational' motivations, or rhetorical purposes.
               Two syntactically distinct types of conventionalized fillers can
               be distinguished: placeholders and hesitatives (also called
               hesitators). Placeholders are referential and morphosyntactically
               integrated, while hesitatives are neither. Strikingly, even
               though fillers are cross-linguistically widespread, dedicated
               studies of such items in particular languages are still largely
               lacking. This collective volume comprises in-depth descriptions
               of conventionalized fillers in a substantial variety of languages
               from Eurasia, Papunesia, Australia, and the Americas, hoping to
               stimulate typological research on fillers, both hesitatives and
               placeholders. The book aims to contribute to a better visibility
               of the topic among general linguists, to make data and analyses
               accessible that will be useful for further typological studies on
               the topic, and to provide models for descriptive linguists. The
               introductory chapter discusses issues emerging from the previous
               literature and offers a new typology of fillers. It also
               highlights the major findings of the eleven remaining chapters.
               Each of these contains a detailed and typologically informed
               analysis of fillers in one or several underdescribed languages,
               based on corpora of natural speech and focusing on lexical
               fillers rather than on phenomena below the word-level (phonetic
               lengthening, truncation) or above the word-level (such as idioms
               and discourse markers like `you know', or rhetorical questions
               like `what's the word for that?'). The chapters cover a large
               amount of diversity, both in terms of languages and with respect
               to the type of filler. They focus on (i) the criteria for
               identification of the various types of fillers and the
               terminology used, keeping in mind that the domain is still

              differs based on the ability of the human gaze cue model to
              manually interact with the targets. Whereas gaze cues consistently
              impacted RTs, movement trajectories may only be affected when the
              hands of the human model had the potential to interact with the
              target. However, the perceived ability to interact with the
              targets was confounded by the proximity between the model's hands
              and the targets. The current study explored if the influence of
              gaze cues on movement trajectories is shaped by the model's
              potential to access and interact with the targets using their
              hands or simply the proximity of the hands. A centrally presented
              human model randomly gazed towards one of two peripheral target
              locations. Participants executed aiming movements to targets that
              non-predictively appeared at one location at a stimulus onset
              asynchrony of 100, 350, or 850 ms. In Experiment 1, the model's
              hands could not directly access the targets as each was holding a
              tray. In Experiment 2, the hands had direct access to the targets,
              but their palms-downwards orientation and wrist-flexed posture
              rendered efficiently interacting with the targets unlikely.
              Although RTs showed a facilitation effect of the gaze cue in both
              experiments, changes in movement trajectories were only observed
              when the model had direct access to the target (Experiment 2). The
              results of the current study suggest that the gaze model's direct
              hand access is necessary for the social gaze cues to influence

	abstract = {Abstract The hypothesis of extended cognition (HEC) casts human
               cognition as constitutively dependent on its bodily and
               environmental context. Drawing on recent empirical work on
               `cognitive offloading', HEC's defenders claim that information
               processing offloaded onto such brain-external resources is
               sometimes `genuinely' cognitive. But while debates about
               offloading have a high profile in philosophy of cognitive
               science, surprisingly little attention has been paid to the fact
               that paradigm cases of offloading are intentional actions. As a
               result, opposition to HEC is driven in part by unarticulated
               intuitions about the metaphysics of human agency. Thinking of
               action as a kind of interface between separately constituted
               intentions and bodily movements can make HEC look problematic.
               But while this view of agency has been popularised -- most
               prominently by Donald Davidson -- as analytic philosophy of
               action's `standard story', it has come under pressure from
               philosophers influenced by Elizabeth Anscombe's very different
               account. According to this, actions express an agent's intention
               only in so far as they fit into the right kind teleologically
               structured worldly context. In this paper, I'll argue that HEC's
               supporters should adopt an Anscombean model of action. That is,
               they should understand cognitive offloading as a manifestation of
               human agency's general dependence on its bodily and environmental
               setting.},

               consuming project in many fields. Philosophers drawing on studies
               of animal behavior are working to revise some of the standard
               cognitive requirements in hopes of linking the origins of human
               language to non-human animal communication. This work depends on
               updates to Grice's theory of communicative intention and
               Millikan's teleosemantics. Yet the classic idea of speaker
               meaning on which these new projects rest presupposes coherent,
               stable, individual, internal, and prior intention as a cognitive
               or mental state, which is also the framework presupposed in
               theory of mind. This framework neglects the co-authored nature of
               communicative intentions and is thereby at odds with enactivist
               views of cognition. In this paper we draw on the idea of
               participatory sense-making alongside research on non-human animal
               communication to identify utterances---co-authored meaningful
               acts---as the token of communicative activity cross-species.
               Utterances by our definition are expressive, relational, and work
               without mindreading. In closing we propose the possibility of
               dialogical subjectivity, and engage with animal studies to show
               that some species exhibit its traits.},

               field in cognitive psychology suggests that many important
               functions like memory of incidents, reasoning, and attention
               depend on the way we segment the ongoing stream of perception
               (Zacks \& Swallow, 2007). An open question still is, how the
               structure generated from a perceptual stream translates into
               behavior. To address this question, we combined the findings in
               event segmentation literature with another influential body of
               literature that analyzes mechanisms behind the control of
               individual actions (Frings et al., 2020). Specifically, we
               analyzed how two very basic mechanisms in action control (binding
               and retrieval) are affected by boundaries between events. Two
               comic scenarios with different characters were used to implement
               events and boundaries between events. In two experiments, we
               measured binding and retrieval between individually executed
               responses that could be part of the same or separate events. In
               Experiment 1, we found larger binding effects for responses that
               were integrated within an event than for responses that had to be
               integrated across an event boundary. In Experiment 2, we found
               that the effect of retrieval of a past response on further
               actions was hampered by an event boundary. Together, the
               experiments indicate that the structure we pick up from our
               environment can translate into ongoing action via modulation of
               the two basic mechanisms binding and retrieval. (PsycInfo

                   of LLMs, there has been little research on whether they can
                   generate valid creativity assessments for humans despite the
                   increasingly central role of creativity in modern economies.
                   We develop a psychometrically inspired framework for creating
                   test items (questions) for a classic free-response creativity
                   test: the creative problem-solving (CPS) task. Our framework,
                   the creative psychometric item generator (CPIG), uses a
                   mixture of LLM-based item generators and evaluators to
                   iteratively develop new prompts for writing CPS items, such

               and Executive Control (ECN) Networks. Here, we conduct a
               large-scale, multi-center examination of this hypothesis.
               Employing a meta-analytic network neuroscience approach, we
               analyze resting-state fMRI and creative task performance across
               10 independent samples from Austria, Canada, China, Japan, and
               the United States (N = 2433)---constituting the largest and most
               ethnically diverse creativity neuroscience study to date. Using
               time-resolved network analysis, we investigate the relationship
               between creativity (i.e., divergent thinking ability) and dynamic
               switching between DMN and ECN. We find that creativity, but not
               general intelligence, can be reliably predicted by the number of
               DMN-ECN switches. Importantly, we identify an inverted-U
               relationship between creativity and the degree of balance between
               DMN-ECN switching, suggesting that optimal creative performance
               requires balanced brain network dynamics. Furthermore, an
               independent task-fMRI validation study (N = 31) demonstrates
               higher DMN-ECN switching during creative idea generation
               (compared to a control condition) and replicates the inverted-U
               relationship. Therefore, we provide robust evidence across
               multi-center datasets that creativity is tied to the capacity to
               dynamically switch between brain networks supporting spontaneous
               and controlled cognition. Robust evidence that creativity is tied

               feature one task and one source of distraction. Therefore, it is
               unclear how control is allocated in multidimensional
               environments. To address this question, we developed a
               multidimensional task-set interference paradigm, in which people
               need to manage distraction from three independent dimensions. We
               use this task to test whether people adapt to previous conflict
               by enhancing task-relevant information or suppressing
               task-irrelevant information. Three experiments provided strong
               evidence for the latter hypothesis. Moreover, control adaptation
               was highly dimension specific. Conflict from a given dimension
               only affected processing of that same dimension on subsequent
               trials, with no evidence for generalization. A new neural network

               individual distractors on the basis of their interference with
               the current task. They develop a neural model that supports these

               However, while effort regulation has been investigated across a
               wide range of incentive conditions, few investigated the cost of
               effort regulation itself. Across four experiments, we studied the

               expenditure in a perceptual decision-making task
               (random-dot-motion) and a cognitive control task (colour-naming

               represent potential actions so that they can be compared for
               selection, and how are motor commands generated if movement is
               initiated before the final goal is identified? According to one
               hypothesis, the brain averages partially prepared motor plans to
               generate movement when there is goal uncertainty. This is
               consistent with the idea that motor decision making unfolds
               through competition between internal representations of
               alternative actions. An alternative hypothesis holds that only
               one movement, which is optimised for task performance, is
               prepared for execution at any time. Under this conception,
               decisions about the best motor goal given current information are

               movements. Humans also have a remarkable ability to produce and
               perceive speech sounds. We asked if the human speech-auditory
               system could serve as a model to characterize retention of
               sensorimotor memory in a workspace which is functionally
               independent of the visuo-spatial one. Using adaptation to altered
               auditory feedback, we investigated the durability of a newly
               acquired speech-acoustical memory (8- and 24-hour delay), its
               sensitivity to the manner of acquisition (abrupt versus gradual
               perturbation), and factors affecting memory retrieval. We
               observed extensive retention of learning (∼70\%) but found no
               evidence for offline gains. The speech-acoustical memory was
               insensitive to the manner of its acquisition. To assess factors
               affecting memory retrieval, tests were first done in the absence
               of auditory feedback (with masking noise). Under these
               conditions, it appeared there was no memory for prior learning as
               if after an overnight delay, speakers had returned to their
               habitual speech production modes. However, when speech was
               reintroduced, resulting in speech error feedback, speakers
               returned immediately to their fully adapted state. This rapid
               switch shows that the two modes of speech production (adapted and
               habitual) can coexist in parallel in sensorimotor memory. The
               findings demonstrate extensive persistence of speech-acoustical
               memory and reveal context-specific memory retrieval processes in
               speech motor learning. We conclude that the human speech-auditory
               system can be employed to characterize sensorimotor memory in a

               simplest model for predicting reaction time distributions and can
               summarise distributions with as few as two free parameters.
               However, the coordinates for visualising and fitting

               researchers treating LLMs as participants in psychological
               experiments. To facilitate this research, we developed an R
               package called ``MacBehaviour ``
               (https://github.com/xufengduan/MacBehaviour), which interacts
               with over 100 LLMs, including OpenAI's GPT family, the Claude
               family, Gemini, Llama family, and other open-weight models. The
               package streamlines the processes of LLM behavioural
               experimentation by providing a comprehensive set of functions for
               experiment design, stimuli presentation, model behaviour
               manipulation, and logging responses and token probabilities. With
               a few lines of code, researchers can seamlessly set up and
               conduct psychological experiments, making LLM behaviour studies
               highly accessible. To validate the utility and effectiveness of
               ``MacBehaviour,`` we conducted three experiments on GPT-3.5 Turbo,

               essential to many aspects of daily life, from health care to
               finance and education. Across three experiments, we found a
               specific form of curiosity in humans about the quality of their
               own metacognition, using a novel approach that dissociates
               perceptual from metacognitive information searches. Observers
               displayed a strategic balance in their curiosity, alternating
               between a focus on perceptual accuracy and metacognitive
               performance. Depending on the context, this metacognitive
               curiosity was modulated by an internal evaluation of
               metacognition, leading to increased feedback requests when
               metacognition was likely to be inaccurate. Using an ideal

               action phases, as when reaching for, lifting, transporting, and
               replacing a cup of coffee. During such tasks, discrete visual,
               auditory and/or haptic feedback are typically associated with
               mechanical events at the completion of each action phase, as when
               breaking and subsequently making contact between the cup and the
               table. An emerging concept is that important sensorimotor control
               operations, that affect subsequent action phases, are centred on
               these discrete multisensory events. By predicting sensory
               feedback at the completion of action phases, and comparing with
               the actual feedback that arises, task performance can be
               continuously monitored. If errors are detected, the sensorimotor
               system can quickly respond with task-protective corrective
               actions. The aim of this study was to investigate how discrete
               multisensory feedback at the completion of action phases are used
               in these control operations. To investigate this question, 42
               healthy human participants (both male and female) performed a
               visually guided sequential reaching task where auxiliary discrete
               visual, auditory and/or haptic feedback was associated with the
               completion of action phases. Occasionally however, this feedback
               was removed in one or two modalities. The results show that
               although the task was visually guided, its control was critically

               advantages over the nondominant hand, these interlimb differences
               have found to be dependent on task and biomechanical demands. The
               dynamic dominance hypothesis suggests that the left hemisphere is
               specialized for the control of intersegmental dynamics while the
               nondominant right hemisphere is specialized for postural control,
               in right-handers. In a real-world scenario, however, cognitive
               challenges might be expected to modulate these specialized
               behaviors. Therefore, we hypothesized that with increased
               cognitive load, lateralized motor control processes would become
               even more asymmetrical. We recruited 16 right-handed older adults

	abstract = {AbstractComprehenders generate expectations about upcoming
               lexical items in language processing using various types of
               contextual information. However, a number of studies have shown
               that argument roles do not impact neural and behavioral
               prediction measures. Despite these robust findings, some prior
               studies have suggested that lexical prediction might be sensitive
               to argument roles in production tasks such as the cloze task or
               in comprehension tasks when additional time is available for
               prediction. This study demonstrates that both the task and
               additional time for prediction independently influence lexical
               prediction using argument roles, via evidence from closely
               matched electroencephalogram (EEG) and speeded cloze experiments.
               In order to investigate the timing effect, our EEG experiment
               used maximally simple Japanese stimuli such as Bee‐nom/acc sting,
               and it manipulated the time for prediction by changing the
               temporal interval between the context noun and the target verb
               without adding any further linguistic content. In order to
               investigate the task effect, we conducted a speeded cloze study
               that was matched with our EEG study both in terms of stimuli and
               the time available for prediction. We found that both the EEG
               study with additional time for prediction and the speeded cloze
               study with matched timing showed clear sensitivity to argument
               roles, while the EEG conditions with less time for prediction
               replicated the standard pattern of argument role insensitivity.
               Based on these findings, we propose that lexical prediction is
               initially insensitive to argument roles but a monitoring
               mechanism serially inhibits role‐inappropriate candidates. This
               monitoring process operates quickly in production tasks, where it
               is important to quickly select a single candidate to produce,
               whereas it may operate more slowly in comprehension tasks, where
               multiple candidates can be maintained until a continuation is
               perceived. Computational simulations demonstrate that this
               mechanism can successfully explain the task and timing effects
               observed in our experiments.},

               study of the speech errors that occur during the inner recitation
               of tongue-twister-like phrases. Two forms of inner speech were
               tested: inner speech without articulatory movements and
               articulated (mouthed) inner speech. Although mouthing one's inner

               planning, prominent theories assume that such planning should not

               errors that are ``heard'' during its production. The errors
               occurring in articulated inner speech exhibited the phonemic
               similarity effect and the lexical bias effect--two speech-error
               phenomena that, in overt speech, have been localized to an

               and ten years, stratified into terciles; our analysis focused on

               One group of participants usually perceived an action effect
               immediately after the action, another group delayed by 250 ms. In

               effect (Incongruent = Neutral, e.g., ), and brought about a
               sizable facilitation effect (Congruent < Neutral, e.g., ) that
               was absent in the standard (control-primed) Stroop trials. RT
               distribution analysis showed that the pattern of facilitation and

               understanding human and animal cognition. In the context of
               predictive processing, learning is often reduced to optimizing
               the parameters of a generative model with a predefined structure.
               This is known as Bayesian parameter learning. However, to provide
               a comprehensive account of learning, one must also explain how
               the brain learns the structure of its generative model. This
               second kind of learning is known as structure learning. Structure
               learning would involve true structural changes in generative
               models. The purpose of the current paper is to describe the
               processes involved upstream of these structural changes. To do
               this, we first highlight the remarkable compatibility between

               precisely, we argue that predictive processing is able to account

               notion of processing fluency (i.e., the fluency heuristic, na{\"\i}ve
               theory, the discrepancy-attribution hypothesis, absolute fluency,

               initial visual guidance to optimize the subsequent actions. We
               found that 3- to 5-year-old children (n = 23) who exhibited
               visually guided, multi-step planning in a structured tool-use

               a novel piece of evidence from subject displacement in support of
               the claim that phasehood can be deactivated by syntactic
               dependencies during the derivation. We show that (i) hyperraising
               (to subject) constructions are attested in both languages, and
               that (ii) only attitude verbs that encode an indirect evidential

               deactivation account for hyperraising, where the phasehood of a

               (whether or not they admit cascading or interactivity). In

               which these representations are accessed in parallel. According
               to this account, word learning involves the binding of the

               before (pre-planning) and during (online planning) movement.
               Here, we compared these processes and asked whether they recruit
               different cortical areas. Human participants performed three
               single-finger and three multi-finger sequences in a delayed
               movement paradigm while undergoing 7T functional MRI. During
               preparation, primary motor (M1) and somatosensory (S1) areas
               showed pre-activation of the first movement, even without
               increases in overall activation. During production, the temporal
               summation of activity patterns corresponding to constituent
               fingers explained activity in these areas (M1 and S1). In
               contrast, the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) and anterior superior
               parietal lobule (aSPL) showed substantial activation during the
               preparation (pre-planning) of multi-finger compared to
               single-finger sequences. These regions (PMd and aSPL) were also
               more active during production of multi-finger sequences,
               suggesting that pre- and online planning may recruit the same
               regions. However, we observed small but robust differences
               between the two contrasts, suggesting distinct contributions to
               pre- and online planning. Multivariate analysis revealed
               sequence-specific representations in both PMd and aSPL, which
               remained stable across both preparation and production phases.
               Our analyses show that these areas maintain a sequence-specific
               representation before and during sequence production, likely
               guiding the execution-related areas in the production of rapid
               movement sequences.Significance StatementUnderstanding how the
               brain orchestrates complex behavior remains a core challenge in
               human neuroscience. Here, we combine high-resolution neuroimaging
               and a carefully crafted design to study the neural control of
               rapid sequential finger movements, like typing or playing the
               piano. Advancing prior research, we show that the brain areas
               involved in planning these movements maintain those
               representations throughout the execution of the sequence. This
               representational stability across planning and execution suggests
               an intricate connection between these processes. Our results shed
               light on the nuanced contributions of different cortical areas to
               different aspects of coordinating skilled movement. This work is

              inhibition (the ability to suppress specific competing responses)
              and nonselective inhibition (the ability to suppress any
              inappropriate response) during single word production. To this
              end, we combined two well-established research paradigms: the
              picture-word interference task and the stop-signal task. Selective
              inhibition was assessed by instructing participants to name target
              pictures (e.g., dog) in the presence of semantically related
              (e.g., cat) or unrelated (e.g., window) distractor words.
              Nonselective inhibition was tested by occasionally presenting a
              visual stop-signal, indicating that participants should withhold
              their verbal response. The stop-signal was presented early (250
              ms) aimed at interrupting the lexical selection stage, and late
              (325 ms) to influence the word-encoding stage of the speech

              with semantically related distractors than with unrelated
              distractors (semantic interference effect). The results further
              showed that, at both delays, stopping latencies (i.e., stop-signal
              RTs) were prolonged for naming pictures with semantically related
              distractors compared to pictures with unrelated distractors. Taken

               dissociated two aspects of movement planning: control over the
               sequential selection of movement plans, and control over the
               precise timing of movement execution. This distinction is
               particularly relevant in the production of speech: utterances
               contain sequentially ordered words and syllables, but
               articulatory movements are often executed in a non-sequential,
               overlapping manner with precisely coordinated relative timing.
               This study presents a hybrid dynamical model in which competitive
               activation controls selection of movement plans and coupled
               oscillatory systems govern coordination. The model departs from
               previous approaches by ascribing an important role to competitive
               selection of articulatory plans within a syllable. Numerical

               patterns of articulatory timing associated with onsets and codas.

	abstract = {Response inhibition is an essential aspect of cognitive control
               that is necessary for terminating inappropriate preplanned or
               ongoing responses. Response-selective stopping represents a
               complex form of response inhibition where only a subcomponent of
               a multicomponent action must be terminated. In this context, a
               substantial response delay emerges on unstopped effectors after
               the cued effector is successfully stopped. This response delay
               has been termed the stopping interference effect. Converging
               lines of evidence indicate that this effect results from a global
               response inhibition mechanism that is recruited regardless of the
               stopping context. However, behavioral observations reveal that
               the stopping interference effect may not always occur during
               selective stopping. This review summarizes the behavioral and
               neural signatures of response inhibition during selective
               stopping. An overview of selective stopping contexts and the
               stopping interference effect is provided. A ``restart'' model of
               selective stopping is expanded on in light of recent
               neurophysiological evidence of selective and nonselective
               response inhibition. Factors beyond overt action cancellation
               that contribute to the stopping interference effect are
               discussed. Finally, a pause-then-cancel model of action stopping
               is presented as a candidate framework to understand stopping
               interference during response-selective stopping. The extant
               literature indicates that stopping interference may result from
               both selective and nonselective response inhibition processes,
               which can be amplified or attenuated by response conflict, task
               familiarity, and functional coupling.},

	abstract = {The speed at which we move is linked to the speed at which we
               decide to make these movements. Yet, the principles guiding such
               relationship remain unclear: while some studies point towards a
               shared invigoration process boosting decision and movement speed
               jointly, others rather indicate a tradeoff between both levels of
               control, with slower movements accompanying faster decisions.
               Here, we aimed (1) at further investigating the existence of a
               shared invigoration process linking decision and movement and (2)
               at testing the hypothesis that such a link is masked when
               detrimental to the reward rate. To this aim, we tested 62
               subjects who performed the tokens task in two experiments
               (separate sessions): Experiment 1 evaluated how changing decision
               speed affects movement speed while Experiment 2 assessed how
               changing movement speed affects decision speed. In the latter
               experiment, subjects were either encouraged to favor decision
               speed (fast decision group) or decision accuracy (slow decision
               group). Various mixed model analyses revealed a coregulation of
               decision (urgency) and movement speed in Experiment 1 and in the
               fast decision group of Experiment 2, but not in the slow decision
               group despite the fact that these same subjects displayed a
               coregulation effect in Experiment 1. Altogether, our findings
               support the idea that coregulation occurs as a default mode but
               that this form of control is diminished or supplanted by a
               tradeoff relationship, contingent on reward rate maximization.
               Drawing from these behavioral observations, we propose that
               multiple processes contribute to shaping the speed of decisions
               and movements.},

	abstract = {Attention must coordinate with memory to actively anticipate
               sensory input and guide action. Memory content may be biased away
               from veridical when it is functionally adaptive. So far, research
               has considered the biasing of still features in static displays.
               It is unknown whether the biasing of attentional templates can
               functionally adapt dynamic stimuli to facilitate search when
               targets and distractors compete within temporally extended
               contexts. Biasing of dynamic templates would require learning and
               modulatory mechanisms capable of abstracting over space and time
               to guide perception. Four experiments used a novel dynamic visual
               search task combined with a memory probe to test whether dynamic
               attentional templates can be biased. In Experiments 1--3,
               participants searched for a moving target among distractors that
               systematically moved either clockwise or counterclockwise
               relative to the target. On memory probe trials, participants
               recalled the target direction as biased away from the
               distractors. The distortion bias was adaptively changed
               (Experiment 2), grew over time (Experiment 2), and occurred even
               when motion direction was not the target-defining feature
               (Experiment 3). Experiment 4 manipulated the speed of targets and
               distractors to test the generalizability of the findings.
               Participants searched for a target of a given speed among faster
               or slower distractors. Memory probing revealed that participants
               remembered the target speed as biased away from that of
               distractors. Across different tasks, the magnitude of the biasing
               correlated positively with search performance. Our findings
               provide compelling evidence that dynamic stimulus attributes in
               attentional templates can become functionally biased when
               adaptive. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights

              span multiple timescales. This behavior hierarchy is believed to
              arise from a hierarchical neural architecture: Neurons near the
              top of the hierarchy are involved in planning, selecting,
              initiating, and maintaining motor programs, whereas those near the
              bottom of the hierarchy act in concert to produce fine
              spatiotemporal motor activity. In Caenorhabditis elegans, behavior
              on a long timescale emerges from ordered and flexible transitions
              between different behavioral states, such as forward, reversal,
              and turn. On a short timescale, different parts of the animal body
              coordinate fast rhythmic bending sequences to produce directional
              movements. Here, we show that Sublateral Anterior A (SAA), a class
              of interneurons that enable cross-communication between dorsal and
              ventral head motor neurons, play a dual role in shaping behavioral
              dynamics on different timescales. On a short timescale, SAA
              regulate and stabilize rhythmic bending activity during forward
              movements. On a long timescale, the same neurons suppress

              inhibiting Ring Interneuron M (RIM), an integrating neuron that
              helps maintain a behavioral state. These results suggest that

               into a chained sequence, or separately by associating keystrokes

               We theorize that systematic recordkeeping crystallizes memory

               measures), promotes the trust necessary for large-scale human

               of insights and transformations in cognitive science. One of them
               was the simple observation that, quite unlike trial-based tasks
               in a laboratory, natural ecologically valid behaviors almost
               never have context-free starting points. Instead, they produce
               lengthy time series data that can be recorded with dense-sampling

               may have been the trigger that led to a rethinking of what a
               ``representation'' is, and then of what a ``cognitive agent'' is.

               SoA has been suggested to arise from both implicit sensorimotor
               integration as well as higher-level decision processes. SoA is
               typically measured by collecting participants' subjective
               judgments, conflating both implicit and explicit processing.
               Consequently, the interplay between implicit sensorimotor
               processing and explicit agency judgments is not well understood.
               Here, we evaluated in one exploratory and one preregistered
               experiment (N = 60), using a machine learning approach, the
               relation between a well-known mechanism of implicit sensorimotor
               adaptation and explicit SoA judgments. Specifically, we examined
               whether subjective judgments of SoA and sensorimotor conflicts
               could be inferred from hand kinematics in a sensorimotor task
               using a virtual hand (VH). In both experiments participants
               performed a hand movement and viewed a virtual hand making a
               movement that could either be synchronous with their action or
               include a parametric temporal delay. After each movement,
               participants judged whether their actual movement was congruent
               with the movement they observed. Our results demonstrated that
               sensorimotor conflicts could be inferred from implicit motor
               kinematics on a trial by trial basis. Moreover, detection of
               sensorimotor conflicts from machine learning models of kinematic
               data provided more accurate classification of sensorimotor
               congruence than participants' explicit judgments. These results
               were replicated in a second, preregistered, experiment. These
               findings show evidence of diverging implicit and explicit
               processing for SoA and suggest that the brain holds high-quality
               information on sensorimotor conflicts that is not fully utilized

               study, priming was found in a sentence completion task, but there
               was no lexical boost. The existence of abstract priming and the

	abstract = {AbstractWhile it has become standard practice to report the
               reliability of self-report scales, it remains uncommon to do the
               same for experimental paradigms. To facilitate this practice, we
               review old and new ways to compute reliability in reaction-time
               tasks, and we compare their accuracy using a simulation study.
               Highly inaccurate and negatively biased reliability estimates are
               obtained through the common practice of averaging sets of trials
               and submitting them to Cronbach's alpha. Much more accurate
               reliability estimates are obtained using split-half reliability
               methods, especially by computing many random split-half
               correlations and aggregating them in a metric known as
               permutation-based split-half reliability. Through reanalysis of
               existing data and comparison of reliability values reported in
               the literature, we confirm that Cronbach's alpha also tends to be
               lower than split-half reliability in real data. We further
               establish a set of practices to maximize the accuracy of the
               permutation-based split-half reliability coefficient through
               simulations. We find that its accuracy is improved by ensuring
               each split-half dataset contains an approximately equal number of
               trials for each stimulus, by correcting the averaged correlation
               for test length using a modified variant of the Spearman--Brown
               formula, and by computing a sufficient number of split-half
               correlations: around 5,400 are needed to obtain a stable estimate
               for median-based double-difference scores computed from 30
               participants and 256 trials. To conclude, we review the available

	abstract = {IntroductionThis paper provides proof of concept that
               neurolinguistic research on human language syntax would benefit
               greatly by expanding its scope to include evolutionary
               considerations, as well as non-propositional functions of
               language, including naming/nicknaming and verbal aggression. In
               particular, an evolutionary approach can help circumvent the
               so-called granularity problem in studying the processing of
               syntax in the brain, that is, the apparent mismatch between the
               abstract postulates of syntax (e.g. Tense Phrase (TP), Determiner
               Phrase (DP), etc.) and the concrete units of neurobiology
               (neurons, axons, etc.).MethodsFirst, we decompose syntax into its
               evolutionary primitives, identifying one of the earliest stages
               as a simple, flat combination of just one verb and one noun.
               Next, we identify proxies (``living fossils'') of such a stage in
               present-day languages, including compounds and small clauses,
               lacking at least some layers of structure, e.g. TPs and DPs.
               These proxies of ancestral language have been subjected to fMRI
               neuroimaging experiments.ResultsWe discuss the finding that less
               hierarchical small clauses, in contrast to full sentences with
               TPs and DPs, show reduced activation in the left Broca's area
               (BA) 44 and the right basal ganglia, consistent with the
               hypothesis that more recent, more elaborate syntax requires more
               connectivity in the Broca's-basal ganglia network, whose neuronal
               density has been significantly enhanced in recent evolution,
               implicating mutations in FOXP2 and other genes. We also discuss
               the finding that the processing of ancestral verb-noun compounds,
               which are typically used for (derogatory) naming and nicknaming,
               shows enhanced activation in the right fusiform gyrus area (BA
               37), the area that is implicated in the processing of
               metaphoricity and imageability, but also in naming and face
               recognition, opening up an intriguing possibility that the
               enhanced face recognition in humans was facilitated by the early
               emergence of a simple syntactic strategy for naming.DiscussionThe
               considerations in this paper are consistent with the hypothesis
               of a gradual gene-culture co-evolution of syntax and the brain,
               targeting cortico-striatal brain networks. It is also of note
               that a sound grounding in neurobiology of language should in turn

               profile of enhanced episodic and working memory performance.
               However, whether sensory (iconic) memory performance is also
               affected by synesthesia remains unknown. Therefore, we tested 22
               grapheme-color synesthetes and compared their performance in a
               partial-report paradigm with 22 individually matched
               non-synesthete controls. Participants were briefly presented with
               a circular-letter array and required to report the identity of
               the letter at a probed target location after various delays.
               Furthermore, they were required to indicate the subjective
               clarity of the target letter after every trial. The results

               Longstanding, single-process accounts of action-stopping have
               been challenged by recent, two-process, 'pause-then-cancel'
               models. These models propose that action-stopping involves two
               inhibitory processes: 1) a fast Pause process, which broadly
               suppresses the motor system as the result of detecting any
               salient event, and 2) a slower Cancel process, which involves
               motor suppression specific to the cancelled action. A purported
               signature of the Pause process is global suppression, or the
               reduced corticospinal excitability (CSE) of task-unrelated
               effectors early on in action-stopping. However, unlike the Pause
               process, few (if any) motor system signatures of a Cancel process
               have been identified. Here, we used single- and paired-pulse TMS
               methods to comprehensively measure the local physiological
               excitation and inhibition of both responding and task-unrelated
               motor effector systems during action-stopping. Specifically, we
               measured CSE, short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and
               the duration of the cortical silent period (CSP). Consistent with
               key predictions from the pause-then-cancel model, CSE
               measurements at the responding effector indicated that additional
               suppression was necessary to counteract Go-related increases in
               CSE during action-stopping, particularly at later timepoints.
               Increases in SICI on Stop-signal trials did not differ across
               task-related and task-unrelated effectors, or across timepoints.
               This suggests SICI as a potential source of global suppression.
               Increases in CSP duration on Stop-signal trials were more
               prominent at later timepoints and were related to individual
               differences in CSE. Our study provides further evidence from

               information is corrupted by noise, the brain is thought to
               process it probabilistically, and integrate it with prior belief
               about arm posture, following Bayes' rule. Here, we combined
               computational modeling with behavioral experimentation to test
               this hypothesis. The model conceives the perception of arm
               posture as the combination of a probabilistic kinematic chain
               composed by the shoulder, elbow, and wrist angles, compromised
               with additive Gaussian noise, with a Gaussian prior about these
               joint angles. We tested whether the model explains errors in a

              active process. We probed the mechanisms that determine where and
              why comprehenders posit gaps during incremental processing using
              Norwegian as our test language. First, we investigated why active
              filler-gap dependency resolution is suspended inside island
              domains like embedded questions in some languages.
              Processing-based accounts hold that resource limitations prevent
              gap-filling in embedded questions across languages, while
              grammar-based accounts predict that active gap-filling is only
              blocked in languages where embedded questions are grammatical
              islands. In a self-paced reading study, we find that Norwegian
              participants exhibit filled-gap effects inside embedded questions,
              which are not islands in the language. The findings are consistent
              with grammar-based, but not processing, accounts. Second, we asked
              if active filler-gap processing can be understood as a special
              case of probabilistic ambiguity resolution within an
              expectation-based framework. To do so, we tested whether
              word-by-word surprisal values from a neural language model could
              predict the location and magnitude of filled-gap effects in our
              behavioral data. We find that surprisal accurately tracks the
              location of filled-gap effects but severely underestimates their
              magnitude. This suggests either that mechanisms above and beyond

               in which ambiguous analyses are accounted separately in discrete
               distributions. By superposing activation patterns that serve as
               cues to other activation patterns, the model is able to maintain
               multiple syntactically complex analyses superposed in a finite
               working memory, propagate this ambiguity through multiple
               intervening words, then resolve this ambiguity in a way that
               produces a measurable predictor that is proportional to the log
               conditional probability of the disambiguating word given its
               context, marginalizing over all remaining analyses. The results
               are indeed consistent in cases of complex structural ambiguity

              in current theoretical frameworks and the resulting difficulty in
              interpreting available evidence. To compensate for limited
              theoretical predictions regarding response durations in spoken
              language, we turn to other fields, such as written production and
              motor control, to provide informative analogies. In written
              production, reliable effects on durations have been observed but
              the field similarly suffers from the absence of clear predictions
              from the available models, limiting interpretations. Since word
              durations are the result of motor programming and execution,
              evidence from motor control is particularly relevant. Recent
              theoretical proposals suggest that planning and execution stages
              overlap in time, with response planning continuing even after the
              initiation of the motor response, making variations in durations
              arise from either planning or execution processes. In addition,
              they propose a gating mechanism to launch response initiation.
              Similar dynamics could be easily assumed in language production,
              which could help bridge the gap from response selection to
              response execution and extend current models of language
              production to account for motor execution and predict word

               as expression, gaze following, and attention-getters, which are
               used by extant non-human great apes, communicative pointing

               self-talk goes back at least to Plato, it is not immediately
               clear how to state this thesis precisely. The aim of the paper is
               to spell out the notion that we think in language by recourse to
               recent work on inner speech. To that end, inner speech and overt
               speech are briefly compared. I then propose that inner speaking
               be defined as a mental episode that substantially engages the
               speech production system; the underlying model of speech
               production is sketched. Next, the cognitive role of inner
               speaking is explored, especially its role in thinking and
               reasoning. The question of whether it is a way of making thoughts
               accessible (to whomever) or whether it is a means of thinking
               itself is raised. I argue that there are two reasons for assuming
               that, occasionally, we think in language. More specifically, I
               will claim that some instances of thinking are instances of inner
               speaking as they exploit certain properties of natural language,
               and that some instances of inner speaking are instances of
               thinking as they play a decisive role in paradigmatic cases of
               thinking that result from internalizing and re-using certain

               proposes that the internal syntax of Portuguese gerund clauses
               and the gradience in their degree of defectiveness may be
               explained by an interplay between their external syntax (locus of
               merge), agreement relations between embedded Tense and matrix
               Tense and the presence/absence of an intervening head. We first
               revisit the distinction between peripheral adverbial gerund
               clauses and central adverbial gerund clauses and show that their
               internal syntax correlates with their external syntax: central
               adverbial gerund clauses are merged in lower positions and appear
               to be more defective. We derive their defectiveness from the
               agree relation established between embedded T and matrix T. We
               then consider predicative gerund clauses and show that they are
               even more defective and restricted in their aspectual value,
               lacking a T head. Finally, we consider predicative gerund clauses
               introduced by como `as' and show that, although they are merged
               in a low position, they are less defective than central adverbial
               gerund clauses. We attribute this mismatch between the internal
               and external syntax of this specific type of gerund clause to the
               presence of the Predicate head como, which intervenes between
               matrix T and embedded T and blocks the agreement relation.},

              3-dimensional whole-arm sequence task with the non-dominant left
              arm compared to the dominant right arm. Thirty-one right-hand
              dominant adults completed two consecutive days of practice of a
              motor sequence task presented in a virtual environment with either
              their dominant right or non-dominant left arm. Targets were
              presented one-at-a-time alternating between Random and Repeated
              sequences. Task performance was indicated by the time to complete
              the sequence (response time), and kinematic measures (hand path
              distance, peak velocity) were used to examine how movements
              changed over time. While the Left Arm group was slower than the
              Right Arm group at baseline, both groups significantly improved
              response time with practice with the Left Arm group demonstrating
              greater gains. The Left Arm group improved performance by
              decreasing hand path distance (straighter path to targets) while
              the Right Arm group improved performance through a smaller
              decrease in hand path distance combined with increasing peak
              velocity. Gains made during practice on Day 1 were retained on Day
              2 for both groups. Overall, individuals reaching with the
              non-dominant left arm learned the whole-arm motor sequence task
              but did so through a different strategy than individuals reaching
              with the dominant right arm. The strategy adopted for the learning
              of movement sequences that require whole-arm movements may be
              impacted by differences in reach control between the nondominant

              utterances than in shorter ones (e.g., 'The Santa is decorating
              the Christmas trees' vs. 'The Santa is decorating the Christmas
              tree and the window'). Given that a rise in pitch frequently
              occurs in response to increased mental effort, we explore the link
              between higher pitch at the beginning of an utterance and the
              cognitive demands of sentence planning for speech production. To
              modulate the cognitive resources available for generating a
              message in a visual world speech production task, the study
              implemented a dual-task paradigm. Participants described pictures
              depicting events with multiple actors. In one-half of these
              descriptions, the participants memorized three nouns, later
              recalling them and answering related questions. The results
              demonstrate both cognitive and linguistic influences on sentence
              intonation. Specifically, intonation peaks at the beginning of
              longer utterances were higher than in shorter ones, and they were
              lower under the condition of memory load than under no load.
              Measurements of eye gaze indicated a very short processing delay
              at the outset of processing the picture and the sentence, which
              was rapidly overcome by the start of speech. The short time frame
              of restricted cognitive resources thus was manifested in the
              lowering of the intonation peaks. These findings establish a novel
              link between language-related memory span and sentence intonation
              and warrant further study to investigate the cognitive mechanisms

               temporal reasoning system - of which the former is both
               phylogenetically and ontogenetically more primitive than the
               latter, and which are at work alongside each other in adult human
               cognition. We describe the main features of each of the two
               systems, the types of behavior the more primitive temporal
               updating system can support, and the respects in which it is more
               limited than the temporal reasoning system. We then use the
               distinction between the two systems to interpret findings in
               comparative and developmental psychology, arguing that animals

               compensation within a movement and longer-term adaptation of
               subsequent movements. Although adaptation is hypothesized to
               occur whenever a sensory error is perceived (including after a
               single exposure to altered feedback), adaptation of articulatory
               movements in speech has only been observed after repeated
               exposure to auditory perturbations, questioning both current
               theories of speech sensorimotor adaptation and the universality
               of more general theories of adaptation. We measured
               single-exposure or 'one-shot' learning in a large dataset in
               which participants were exposed to intermittent, unpredictable
               perturbations of their speech acoustics. On unperturbed trials
               immediately following these perturbed trials, participants
               adjusted their speech to oppose the preceding shift,
               demonstrating that learning occurs even after a single exposure
               to auditory error. These results provide critical support for
               current theories of sensorimotor adaptation in speech and align
               speech more closely with learning in other motor domains.},

               was examined in children and adults. English-speaking adults and
               4-year-olds viewed motion events while their eye movements were
               monitored. Half of the participants in each age group described
               each event (Linguistic task), whereas the other half studied the
               events for an upcoming memory test (Nonlinguistic task). All
               participants then completed a memory test in which they
               identified changes to manners of motion and path endpoints in
               target events. In the Nonlinguistic task, eye movements and
               memory responses revealed striking similarities across age
               groups. Adults and preschoolers attended to manner and path
               endpoints with similar timing, and in the memory test both
               successfully detected manner and path changes at similar rates.
               Substantial differences in production emerged between age groups
               in the Linguistic task: whereas adults usually mentioned both
               manners and paths in their event descriptions, preschoolers
               tended to omit one event component or the other. However, eyegaze
               patterns remained equivalent across the two age groups, with both
               children and adults allocating more attention to event components
               that they planned to talk about. Children in the Linguistic task
               were at chance in the memory test, whereas adults actually showed
               a memory benefit as compared to the Nonlinguistic task. We
               conclude that developmental differences in the description of
               motion events are not due to pure attentional differences between
               adults and children, but leave open the possibility that they
               stem from limitations that are solely linguistic in nature or
               that arise at the interface of attention and language production.},

               real-time language processing, is crucial for children's language
               and communication development. To explore the early development
               of children's real-time language production, this study
               investigated Chinese preschool children's pausing strategies in
               narratives and their associations with verbal working memory and
               vocabulary abilities. METHOD: A picture-elicited narrative task
               was employed. Sixty Mandarin-speaking children aged 4-5 years
               were asked to tell a story according to the book Frog, Where Are
               You? The pausing types and positions in narratives were coded and
               analyzed. Additionally, children's verbal working memory and
               vocabulary were measured. RESULTS: The results showed that 4- to
               5-year-old children prefer to use silent pauses and tend to
               produce pauses within clauses. The total frequency of pausing
               decreases with age and shows a significant gender difference.
               Girls prefer to use within-clause pauses, whereas boys prefer to
               use between-clause pauses. More importantly, children's pausing
               frequency is closely associated with their verbal working memory
               and vocabulary, in which working memory plays a more important
               role. CONCLUSIONS: This study is a first-step exploration of
               pausing strategies in 4- to 5-year-old Chinese children's
               narratives. The developmental characteristics of pausing
               strategies shown in typically developing children serve as a
               crucial reference for interventions for children with language
               deficits.},

               syntactic errors that are ungrammatical in their target language,
               but are grammatical in another language. One of the most
               well-known examples is medial wh-question errors in
               English-speaking children's wh-questions (e.g., What do you think
               who the cat chased? from Thornton, 1990). The evidence for this
               non-target-like structure in both production and comprehension
               has been taken to support the existence of innate, syntactic
               parameters that define all possible grammatical variation, which
               serve as a top-down constraint guiding children's language

               production and comprehension experiments that challenge this

               medial wh-question errors in children's sentence production
               (Experiment 1), we saw a reduction in evidence indicating that
               English-speaking children assign interpretations that conform to
               the medial wh-question pattern (Experiment 2). Crucially, we
               found no correlation between production and comprehension errors
               (Experiment 3). We suggest that these errors are the result of
               children's immature sentence production mechanisms rather than

               responses1,2. Despite the distributed nature of task-relevant
               representations3-10, it remains unclear how transformations
               between sensory input, evidence integration, motor planning and
               execution are orchestrated across brain areas and dimensions of
               neural activity. Here we addressed this question by recording
               brain-wide neural activity in mice learning to report changes in
               ambiguous visual input. After learning, evidence integration
               emerged across most brain areas in sparse neural populations that
               drive movement-preparatory activity. Visual responses evolved
               from transient activations in sensory areas to sustained
               representations in frontal-motor cortex, thalamus, basal ganglia,
               midbrain and cerebellum, enabling parallel evidence accumulation.
               In areas that accumulate evidence, shared population activity
               patterns encode visual evidence and movement preparation,
               distinct from movement-execution dynamics. Activity in
               movement-preparatory subspace is driven by neurons integrating
               evidence, which collapses at movement onset, allowing the
               integration process to reset. Across premotor regions,
               evidence-integration timescales were independent of intrinsic
               regional dynamics, and thus depended on task experience. In
               summary, learning aligns evidence accumulation to action
               preparation in activity dynamics across dozens of brain regions.

              issued during the mere preparation of movements. To test this
              idea, we combined a delayed movement task with a virtual reality
              based manipulation of visuomotor congruence during functional
              magnetic resonance imaging. Participants executed simple hand
              movements after a delay. During the delay, two aspects of the
              upcoming movement could be cued: the movement type and the
              visuomotor mapping (i.e. congruence of executed hand movements and
              visual movement feedback by a glove-controlled virtual hand).
              Frontoparietal areas showed increased delay period activity when
              preparing pre-specified movements (cued > uncued). The cerebellum

               non-linguistic cognitive impairments can appear alongside
               language deficits in individuals with aphasia. One vulnerable
               cognitive domain is executive function, an umbrella term for the
               higher-level cognitive processes that allow us to direct our
               behavior towards a goal. Studies in healthy adults reveal that
               executive function abilities are supported by inner speech, the
               ability to use language silently in one's head. Therefore, inner
               speech may mediate the connection between language and executive
               function deficits in individuals with aphasia. Here, we
               investigated whether inner speech ability may link language and
               cognitive impairments in 59 adults with chronic, post-stroke
               aphasia. We used two approaches to measure inner speech: one
               based on internal retrieval of words and one based on internal
               retrieval plus silent manipulation of the retrieved phonological
               forms. Then, we examined relationships between these two
               approaches to measuring inner speech and five aspects of
               executive function ability: response inhibition, conflict
               monitoring/resolution, general task-switching ability,
               phonological control, and semantic control. We also looked for
               dissociations between inner speech ability and executive function

               speech (across multiple measurement approaches) and all aspects
               of executive function except for response inhibition. We also
               found evidence for a double dissociation: many participants show
               intact executive function despite poor inner speech, and vice
               versa, so neither process is strictly reliant on the other. We
               suggest that this work provides preliminary evidence of a
               bidirectional relationship between inner speech and executive
               function: inner speech supports some aspects of executive
               function via internal self-cueing and certain aspects of

               updated on a trial-to-trial basis with the feedback of contact
               locations on the object. This is as opposed to the classically

               type before movement initiation within the framework of motor

               investigate the neural overlap between speech production and
               three speech perception conditions: speech‐in‐noise, spectrally
               degraded speech and linguistically complex speech. Neural overlap
               was observed in the left frontal, insular and temporal regions.
               Key nodes included the left frontal operculum (FOC), left
               posterior lateral part of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), left
               planum temporale (PT), and left pre‐supplementary motor area
               (pre‐SMA). The left IFG activation was consistently observed
               during linguistic processing, suggesting sensitivity to the
               linguistic content of speech. In comparison, the left pre‐SMA
               activation was observed when processing degraded and noisy
               signals, indicating sensitivity to signal quality. Activations of
               the left PT and FOC activation were noted in all conditions, with
               the posterior FOC area overlapping in all conditions. Our
               meta‐analysis reveals context‐independent (FOC, PT) and
               context‐dependent (pre‐SMA, posterior lateral IFG) regions within
               the speech motor system during challenging speech perception.
               These regions could contribute to sensorimotor integration and
               executive cognitive control for perception and production.},

	abstract = {AbstractMany skills that humans acquire throughout their lives,
              such as playing video games or sports, require substantial motor
              learning and multi-step planning. While both processes are
              typically studied separately, they are likely to interact during
              the acquisition of complex motor skills. In this work, we studied
              this interaction by assessing human performance in a sequential
              decision-making task that requires the learning of a non-trivial
              motor mapping. Participants were tasked to move a cursor from
              start to target locations in a grid world, using a standard
              keyboard. Notably, the specific keys were arbitrarily mapped to a
              movement rule resembling the Knight chess piece. In Experiment 1,
              we showed the learning of this mapping in the absence of planning,
              led to significant improvements in the task when presented with
              sequential decisions at a later stage. Computational modeling
              analysis revealed that such improvements resulted from an
              increased learning rate about the state transitions of the motor
              mapping, which also resulted in more flexible planning from trial
              to trial (less perseveration or habitual responses). In Experiment
              2, we showed that incorporating mapping learning into the planning
              process, allows us to capture (1) differential task improvements
              for distinct planning horizons and (2) overall lower performance
              for longer horizons. Additionally, model analysis suggested that
              participants may limit their search to three steps ahead. We
              hypothesize that this limitation in planning horizon arises from
              capacity constraints in working memory, and may be the reason
              complex skills are often broken down into individual subroutines
              or components during learning.},

               behaviors, including the way we talk. Psycholinguistic work has
               conceptualized alignment as the result of automatic cognitive
               mechanisms that operate to facilitate processing and
               communication. Sociolinguistic work has focused on the role of
               social identity and interactional strategy in explaining
               linguistic alignment. We draw on these two largely distinct
               traditions to investigate socially mediated syntactic alignment
               with the goal of understanding how social perception and
               cognition influence the mechanisms involved in alignment. A novel
               web-based paradigm was employed to collect speech data from a
               large socially heterogeneous sample. Participants listened to one
               of three speakers, each with a different accent, deliver an
               ideologically charged diatribe. Participants then completed a
               picture description task to assess the degree of syntactic
               alignment. Finally, participants completed a comprehensive social
               questionnaire designed to assess a wide range of social
               dimensions, which were tested as predictors of alignment. Our
               results suggest that syntactic alignment is to some extent
               automatic, but socially mediated. We found an overall alignment
               effect across social conditions and independent of social
               perceptions. However, the degree of alignment was influenced by a
               number of factors, including the perceived standardness of the
               passage speaker's accent, participants' perceived similarity to
               the speaker, and participants' preference for compromise as a
               conflict management style. These findings are discussed in terms
               of theories of linguistic alignment and speech production.},

               and nonselective inhibition (the ability to suppress any
               inappropriate response) during single word production. To this
               end, we combined two well-established research paradigms: the
               picture-word interference task and the stop-signal task.
               Selective inhibition was assessed by instructing participants to
               name target pictures (e.g., dog) in the presence of semantically
               related (e.g., cat) or unrelated (e.g., window) distractor words.
               Nonselective inhibition was tested by occasionally presenting a
               visual stop-signal, indicating that participants should withhold
               their verbal response. The stop-signal was presented early (250
               ms) aimed at interrupting the lexical selection stage, and late
               (325 ms) to influence the word-encoding stage of the speech
               production process. We found longer naming latencies for pictures
               with semantically related distractors than with unrelated
               distractors (semantic interference effect). The results further
               showed that, at both delays, stopping latencies (i.e.,
               stop-signal RTs) were prolonged for naming pictures with
               semantically related distractors compared to pictures with
               unrelated distractors. Taken together, our findings suggest that
               selective and nonselective inhibition, at least partly, share a

               systems is a central challenge for a neural theory of embodied
               cognition. To structure this challenge, we borrow terms from
               Searle's analysis of intentionality in its two directions of fit
               and six psychological modes (perception, memory, belief,
               intention‐in‐action, prior intention, desire). We postulate that
               intentional states are instantiated by neural activation patterns
               that are stabilized by neural interaction. Dynamic instabilities
               provide the neural mechanism for initiating and terminating
               intentional states and are critical to organizing sequences of
               intentional states. Beliefs represented by networks of concept
               nodes are autonomously learned and activated in response to
               desired outcomes. The neural dynamic principles of an intentional
               agent are demonstrated in a toy scenario in which a robotic agent

               under-powered studies that have been shared in the past years.
               While problematic, having the possibility to recruit (lots of)
               participants (for a lot of time) is realistically not achievable
               for many research facilities. Factors that hinder the reaching of
               optimal sample sizes are, to name but a few, research costs,
               participants' availability and commitment, and logistics. We
               challenge these issues by introducing PsySuite, an Android app
               designed to foster a remote approach to multimodal behavioral
               testing. To validate PsySuite, we first evaluated its ability to
               generate stimuli appropriate to rigorous psychophysical testing,
               measuring both the app's accuracy (i.e., stimuli's onset, offset,
               and multimodal simultaneity) and precision (i.e., the stability
               of a given pattern across trials), using two different smartphone
               models. We then evaluated PsySuite's ability to replicate
               perceptual performances obtained using a classic psychophysical
               paradigm, comparing sample data collected with the app against
               those measured via a PC-based setup. Our results showed that
               PsySuite could accurately reproduce stimuli with a minimum
               duration of 7 ms, 17 ms, and 30 ms for the auditory, visual, and
               tactile modalities, respectively, and that perceptual

               effects of procedural task repetition on learners' task
               performance (i.e., syntactic complexity in relation to lexical
               complexity). We investigated how task repetition results in
               differences at the group and individual level across each task
               interval (T = 7). Intermediate‐level Saudi learners of English (N
               = 93) performed a written task biweekly over the course of a
               whole semester. To control for text type, mode and tenor were
               fixed at each data elicitation moment, but field was varied in
               these writing tasks to keep learners engaged. Using Bayesian
               generalized additive mixed models and mixed location‐scale
               models, we analyzed specific ways that groups and individuals
               changed across time over the course of each task iteration and in
               relation to previous points. Our results showed that learners'
               task performance demonstrated nonlinearity, stability, and
               variability with meaningfully different effects on individual and
               group‐level development over time.},

               concerned with the way in which speakers choose between syntactic

               that speakers address their contributions directly to their

               descriptions which had been addressed to a third person. This

               `sub‐intentional actions', actions which are not intentional

               counterexamples to the dominant view on which the difference
               between actions and other events is their intentionality. In this

               Firstly, I show that the main argument for the sub‐intentionality
               of these actions has a structural fault. Secondly, I argue that
               two apparently natural ways to remedy this fail. Thirdly, I argue

               sub‐intentional actions actually undermines the theoretical
               significance of the view. Ultimately, my aim is to show that

               handle unexpected visual changes, such as a change in target
               location. It is important to know when these redirections start,
               i.e. the online reaction time (oRT), but this information is not
               readily evident since redirections are embedded within a
               time-varying baseline movement which differs from trial to trial.
               The one previous study that evaluated the performance of
               different oRT identification methods utilized simulated
               redirections with the exact same onset, rather than a range of
               onsets as would be typically encountered. We addressed this gap
               by utilizing batches of ``hybrid'' trials with temporal spread in
               their oRTs. Each hybrid trial combined a sampled baseline
               movement with an idealized corrective response. Two new methods
               had the most accurate identification of online reaction times: i)
               a threshold-aligned grand mean regression and ii) a
               template-based approach we term the canonical correction search.
               The threshold-aligned grand mean regression is simple to
               implement and effective. The canonical correction search is a
               more complex procedure but arguably better linked to the
               underlying response. Applying the two methods to a published
               dataset revealed more delayed oRTs than was previously reported
               along with new information such as the width of oRT
               distributions. Taken together, our results demonstrate the

               structures affect the generalizability of an analysis. Here, we

               testing should minimally adhere to the standards that have been
               in place for many decades. Through theoretical arguments and
               Monte Carlo simulation, we show that LMEMs generalize best when
               they include the maximal random effects structure justified by
               the design. The generalization performance of LMEMs including
               data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon
               modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on
               moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but
               with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally,

               describing how this notion accounts for visually guided motor
               behaviors. On the one hand, dispositional accounts of affordances
               explain how affordances emerge from the encounter of the agent's
               perceptual-motor skills, with an object offering possible
               interactions, as behavioral dispositional properties. On the
               other hand, cognitive neuroscience explains what neural
               mechanisms are required for agents to detect affordances,
               resulting from an internal processing. As the literature
               recognized, it would be beneficial to connect these two stories.
               We propose an important step into this connection, showing how a
               dispositional notion of affordance can be distinguished into two
               versions, the Dispositional Account of Nomological Affordance

               Response, and how to complement different aspects of visuomotor
               processing for affordance extraction, discussed in neuroscience,
               with them. An important benefit of our proposal is that it

               integration of external information about the spatial layout of
               potential actions and knowledge of their costs and benefits.
               Previous studies have shown that when given a choice between
               voluntary reaching movements, humans tend to prefer actions with
               lower biomechanical costs. However, these studies primarily
               focused on decisions made before the onset of movement
               (``decide-then-act'' scenarios), and it is not known to what
               extent their conclusions generalize to many real-life situations,
               in which decisions occur during ongoing actions
               (``decide-while-acting''). For example, one recent study found
               that biomechanical costs did not influence decisions to switch
               from a continuous manual tracking movement to a point-to-point
               movement, suggesting that biomechanical costs may be disregarded
               in decide-while-acting scenarios. To better understand this
               surprising result, we designed an experiment in which
               participants were faced with the decision between continuing to
               track a target moving along a straight path or changing paths to
               track a new target that gradually moved along a direction that
               deviated from the initial one. We manipulated tracking direction,
               angular deviation rate, and side of deviation, allowing us to
               compare scenarios where biomechanical costs favored either
               continuing or changing the path. Crucially, here the choice was
               always between two continuous tracking actions. Our results show
               that in this situation, decisions clearly took biomechanical
               costs into account. Thus, we conclude that biomechanics are not
               disregarded during decide-while-acting scenarios, but rather,
               that cost comparisons can only be made between similar types of
               actions.},

               conducting online experiments. We additionally evaluated the

               observed when administered via touchscreen devices compared to
               keyboard devices. Our findings indicate similar performance

               languages? Here, we reframe George Kingsley Zipf's proposed ``law
               of abbreviation'' within a more general framework that relates it
               to cognitive pressures that affect speakers and listeners. In
               this new framework, speakers' drive to reduce effort (Zipf's
               proposal) is counteracted by the need for low‐frequency words to
               have word forms that are sufficiently distinctive to allow for
               accurate recognition by listeners. To support this framework, we
               replicate and extend recent work using the prevalence of subword
               phonemic sequences (phonotactic probability) to measure speakers'
               production effort in place of Zipf's measure of length. Across
               languages and corpora, phonotactic probability is more strongly
               correlated with word frequency than word length. We also show
               this measure of ease of speech production (phonotactic
               probability) is strongly correlated with a measure of perceptual
               difficulty that indexes the degree of competition from
               alternative interpretations in word recognition. This is
               consistent with the claim that there must be trade‐offs between
               these two factors, and is inconsistent with a recent proposal
               that phonotactic probability facilitates both perception and
               production. To our knowledge, this is the first work to offer an
               explanation why long, phonotactically improbable word forms

               involved a fast-velocity initial phase and a low-velocity final

               science, dual process theory (DPT) remains a popular framework
               for theorizing about human cognition. Its central hypothesis is
               that cognitive processing can be subsumed under two generic
               types. In this paper, we argue that the putative success and
               popularity of this framework remains overstated and gives rise to
               certain misunderstandings. If DPT has predictive and/or
               explanatory power, it is through offering descriptions of
               cognitive phenomena via functional analysis. But functional
               descriptions require an individuation strategy. To date, there
               has been no systematic exploration of how Type 1 and Type 2 are
               functionally individuated. Following recent debates in philosophy
               of cognitive science, we consider three individuation strategies
               (i.e., abstraction, reification, fictionalization) and assess the
               legitimacy of each in relation to DPT. This leads us to the
               verdict that the most viable route for justifying DPT is to
               construe Type 1 and Type 2 processes as reifications. We conclude
               that, construed as reifications, the common rationales offered by
               proponents of DPT for demarcating Type 1 and Type 2 processes do

               position, visual feedback, and memory delays, but their influence
               on object placement is unclear. Here, we tested these factors in
               a task where participants placed and oriented a trapezoidal block
               against 2D visual templates displayed on a frontally located
               computer screen. In Experiment 1, participants matched the block
               to three possible orientations: 0o (horizontal), +45o and -45o,
               with gaze fixated 10o to the left/right. The hand and template
               either remained illuminated (closed-loop), or visual feedback was
               removed (open-loop). Here, hand location consistently overshot
               the template relative to gaze, especially in the open-loop task;
               likewise, orientation was influenced by gaze position (depending
               on template orientation and visual feedback). In Experiment 2, a
               memory delay was added, and participants sometimes performed
               saccades (towards, away from, or across the template). In this
               task, the influence of gaze on orientation vanished, but location
               errors were influenced by both template orientation and final
               gaze position. Contrary to our expectations, the previous saccade

               processing, we measured eye movements during the execution of a
               goal-directed throwing task. Participants could fully observe the
               effects of their throwing actions (ball trajectory, and either
               hitting or missing a target) in most of the trials. In a portion
               of the trials, the ball trajectory was not visible, and
               participants only received static information about the outcome.
               We observed a large proportion of predictive saccades, shifting
               gaze toward the goal region before the ball arrived and outcome
               feedback became available. Fixation locations after predictive
               saccades systematically covaried with future ball positions in
               trials with continuous ball flight information, but notably also
               in trials with static outcome feedback and only efferent and
               proprioceptive information about the movement that could be used

               blocks, predictable task-switching and task-cuing paradigms,

               in task switching and theoretical accounts of task preparation.
               We consider preparation processes in two-stage models, consider
               preparation as an all-or-none process, address the question of
               whether preparation is switch-specific, reflect on preparation as

	abstract = {Recent behavioral studies in both humans and rodents have found
               evidence that performance in decision-making tasks depends on two
               different learning processes; one encoding the relationship
               between actions and their consequences and a second involving the
               formation of stimulus-response associations. These learning
               processes are thought to govern goal-directed and habitual
               actions, respectively, and have been found to depend on
               homologous corticostriatal networks in these species. Thus,
               recent research using comparable behavioral tasks in both humans
               and rats has implicated homologous regions of cortex (medial
               prefrontal cortex/medial orbital cortex in humans and prelimbic
               cortex in rats) and of dorsal striatum (anterior caudate in
               humans and dorsomedial striatum in rats) in goal-directed action
               and in the control of habitual actions (posterior lateral putamen
               in humans and dorsolateral striatum in rats). These learning
               processes have been argued to be antagonistic or competing
               because their control over performance appears to be all or none.
               Nevertheless, evidence has started to accumulate suggesting that
               they may at times compete and at others cooperate in the
               selection and subsequent evaluation of actions necessary for
               normal choice performance. It appears likely that cooperation or
               competition between these sources of action control depends not
               only on local interactions in dorsal striatum but also on the
               cortico-basal ganglia network within which the striatum is
               embedded and that mediates the integration of learning with basic
               motivational and emotional processes. The neural basis of the
               integration of learning and motivation in choice and
               decision-making is still controversial and we review some recent
               hypotheses relating to this issue.},

               cognitive/conceptual representations and formal‐logical
               structures of linguistic meaning can be inter‐translated, recast,
               transformed into one another, and so united together, even though
               cognitive/conceptual representations and formal‐logical
               structures of linguistic meaning are apparently distinct in
               ontology and divergent in their form or character. While
               cognitive/conceptual representations are ultimately rooted in
               sensory‐motor systems, formal‐logical structures of linguistic
               meaning are abstractions detached from and independent of the
               actualized world. This paper sketches out the foundations of how
               representations of linguistic meaning in terms of
               cognitive/conceptual structures in Cognitive/Conceptual Semantics
               can be unified with those in terms of formal‐logical structures
               in Formal Semantics. This is done by recasting
               cognitive/conceptual representations in terms of formal‐logical
               structures of linguistic meaning and re‐encoding formal‐logical
               structures of linguistic meaning in terms of cognitive/conceptual
               representations. Then, these two types of semantic
               representations, thus shown representationally equivalent, will
               be related to a series of derivations across levels in neuronal
               networks and dynamics. The general discussion on unifying
               cognitive/conceptual representations of linguistic meaning with
               formal‐logical structures is contextualized within the broader

	abstract = {The current view of perceptual decision-making suggests that once
               a decision is made, only a single motor programme associated with
               the decision is carried out, irrespective of the uncertainty
               involved in decision making. In contrast, we show that multiple
               motor programmes can be acquired on the basis of the preceding
               uncertainty of the decision, indicating that decision uncertainty
               functions as a contextual cue for motor memory. The actions
               learned after making certain (uncertain) decisions are only
               partially transferred to uncertain (certain) decisions.
               Participants were able to form distinct motor memories for the
               same movement on the basis of the preceding decision uncertainty.
               Crucially, this contextual effect generalizes to novel stimuli
               with matched uncertainty levels, demonstrating that decision
               uncertainty is itself a contextual cue. These findings broaden
               the understanding of contextual inference in motor memory,
               emphasizing that it extends beyond direct motor control cues to
               encompass the decision-making process. When people make a
               decision, the actions they take might look similar regardless of
               how they arrived at that decision. In this Article, Hagura et al.

	abstract = {AbstractThe prehensile arms of the cephalopod are among these
              animals most remarkable features, but the neural circuitry
              governing arm and sucker movements remains largely unknown. We
              studied the neuronal organization of the adult axial nerve cord
              (ANC) ofOctopus bimaculoideswith molecular and cellular methods.
              The ANCs, which lie in the center of every arm, are the largest
              neuronal structures in the octopus, containing four times as many
              neurons as found in the central brain. In transverse cross
              section, the cell body layer (CBL) of the ANC wraps around its
              neuropil (NP) with little apparent segregation of sensory and
              motor neurons or nerve exits. Strikingly, when studied in
              longitudinal sections, the ANC is segmented. ANC neuronal cell
              bodies form columns separated by septa, with 15 segments overlying
              each pair of suckers. The segments underlie a modular organization
              to the ANC neuropil: neuronal cell bodies within each segment send
              the bulk of their processes directly into the adjoining neuropil,
              with some reaching the contralateral side. In addition, some nerve
              processes branch upon entering the NP, forming short-range
              projections to neighboring segments and mid-range projections to
              the ANC segments of adjoining suckers. The septa between the
              segments are employed as ANC nerve exits and as channels for ANC
              vasculature. Cellular analysis establishes that adjoining septa
              issue nerves with distinct fiber trajectories, which across two
              segments (or three septa) fully innervate the arm musculature.
              Sucker nerves also use the septa, setting up a nerve fiber
              ``suckerotopy'' in the sucker-side of the ANC. Comparative anatomy
              suggests a strong link between segmentation and flexible
              sucker-laden arms. In the squidDoryteuthis pealeii, the arms and
              the sucker- rich club of the tentacles have segments, but the
              sucker-poor stalk of the tentacles does not. The neural modules
              described here provide a new template for understanding the motor
              control of octopus soft tissues. In addition, this finding

               must pass from the brain to downstream motor circuits through
               descending neurons (DNs). These include small sets of
               command-like neurons that are sufficient to drive behaviours1---the
               circuit mechanisms for which remain unclear. Here we show that
               command-like DNs in Drosophila directly recruit networks of
               additional DNs to orchestrate behaviours that require the active
               control of numerous body parts. Specifically, we found that
               command-like DNs previously thought to drive behaviours alone2--4
               in fact co-activate larger populations of DNs. Connectome
               analyses and experimental manipulations revealed that this
               functional recruitment can be explained by direct excitatory
               connections between command-like DNs and networks of
               interconnected DNs in the brain. Descending population
               recruitment is necessary for behavioural control: DNs with many

               drive complete behaviours and drive only simple stereotyped
               movements in their absence. These DN networks reside within
               behaviour-specific clusters that inhibit one another. These

               in which behaviours are generated through the recruitment of

               how humans can flexibly adapt to rapidly changing contexts. The
               foundation of this cognitive flexibility rests on contextual
               adjustments of cognitive control, which can be tested using the
               list‐wide proportion congruency effect (LWPC). Blocks with mostly
               incongruent (MI) trials show smaller conflict interference
               effects compared to blocks with mostly congruent (MC) trials. A
               critical debate is how proactive and reactive control processes
               drive contextual adjustments. In this preregistered study (N =
               30), we address this conundrum, by using the theta rhythm as a
               key neural marker for cognitive control. In a confound‐minimized
               Stroop paradigm with short alternating MC and MI blocks, we
               tested reaction times, error rates, and participants'
               individualized theta activity (2--7 Hz) in the scalp‐recorded
               electroencephalogram. An LWPC effect was found for both, reaction
               times and error rates. Importantly, the results provided clear
               evidence for reactive control processes in the theta rhythm:
               Theta power was higher in rare incongruent compared with
               congruent trials in MC blocks, but there was no such modulation
               in MI blocks. However, regarding proactive control, there were no
               differences in sustained theta power between MC and MI blocks. A
               complementary analysis of the alpha activity (8--14 Hz) also
               revealed no evidence for sustained attentional resources in MI
               blocks. These findings suggest that contextual adjustments rely
               mainly on reactive control processes in the theta rhythm.
               Proactive control, in the present study, may be limited to a
               flexible attentional shift but does not seem to require sustained

               students, who are signers of Israeli Sign Language, and also
               users of Palestinian Colloquial Arabic (PCA) and written Modern
               Standard Arabic (MSA). Method: Nineteen school-age DHH students
               participated in a sentence elicitation task in which they retold
               events portrayed in 24 videos in PCA and MSA. A control group of
               19 hearing students was tested with the same task. Sentences in
               each language variety were coded for grammatical versus
               ungrammatical productions and for type of morphosyntactic errors
               for the latter. In addition, code-switched words were counted.
               Results: The hearing group showed no morphosyntactic errors,
               whereas the DHH students showed morphosyntactic errors in both
               PCA and MSA. In addition, both groups code-switched in both PCA
               and MSA, with more code-switching in the MSA task than in the PCA
               task. Furthermore, an interaction with age revealed that young
               students code-switched more in MSA and older students
               code-switched more in PCA. Conclusions: It is suggested that the
               morphosyntactic abilities of DHH students are incomplete in both
               language varieties. Lack of spoken language input may negatively
               influence the acquisition of spoken language, which impacts
               further the acquisition of the standard language in diglossic
               contexts. Code-switching is explained as both due to lexical

	abstract = {AbstractWe make physical efforts when we swim, carry shopping
               bags, push heavy doors, or cycle up hills. A growing concern
               among philosophers and scientists in related fields is the
               absence of a well-defined concept for physical efforts. This
               paper addresses this issue by presenting a force-based definition
               of physical efforts. In Sect. 1, we explore the shortcomings of
               existing definitions of effort. Section 2 introduces the
               force-based account of efforts according to which making an
               effort consists in exerting a force so as to make an object move
               or stay at rest. Section 3 introduces three central distinctions
               stemming from the account: failed vs. successful efforts;
               resisted vs. unresisted efforts; and efforts vs. effortful
               actions. Section 4 presents a key objection, to the effect that
               the force-based theory cannot account for the difficulty of
               efforts: efforts usually feel difficult, but effort's difficulty
               is not always a function of the magnitude of force(s) exerted.
               Section 5 argues that the most in-depth account of difficulty so
               far, that developed by Bradford (2015), cannot account for the
               difficulty of efforts. Sections 6 \& 7 develop a novel account of

	abstract = {Error detection serves 2 different functions: prevention and
               cure. Prevention engages post-error slowing to reduce future
               errors, whereas cure engages processes that correct the error.
               Thus, prevention predicts post-error slowing, and cure does not.
               We investigated this distinction in skilled typists in 3
               experiments. In Experiment 1, post-error performance was
               investigated in 800 typists who completed a short continuous
               typing test where correction was disallowed. In Experiments 2 and
               3, post-error performance and post-correction performance were
               investigated by manipulating whether typists were allowed to
               correct their mistakes. Across experiments, there was limited
               evidence that typists used error detection for prevention;
               typists preferred the cure. After making mistakes, they corrected
               them and rapidly resumed typing at normal rates. Post-error
               slowing occurred only when correction was disabled; post-error
               speeding occurred when correction was enabled. This finding
               offers support for the novel hypothesis that post-error slowing
               reflects the inhibition of pre-potent tendencies to correct
               mistakes. Error-detection processes in general will be better
               understood by distinguishing between tasks that allow performers
               to cure their errors through correction rather than reduce their
               errors through prevention.},

	abstract = {AbstractThe ability to change our behavior is one that we
               frequently exert, although determining the mechanisms by which we
               do so is far from trivial. Task switching is a useful
               experimental paradigm for studying cognitive control functions.
               Switching between tasks is associated with a decrement in
               performance, or ``switch-cost,'' relative to repeating the same
               task. We have previously demonstrated that this cost is dependent
               on switching from performing one task to performing another;
               changing only our intended performance does not elicit the same
               performance deficit. Using event-related potentials (ERPs), we
               dissociated two electrophysiological indices mirroring this
               behavioral distinction [Astle, D. E., Jackson, G. M., \&
               Swainson, R. Dissociating neural indices of dynamic cognitive
               control in advance task-set preparation: An ERP study of task
               switching. Brain Res, 1125, 94--103, 2006]. However, what was
               unclear were the specific aspects of performance that were
               critical for triggering the neural mechanisms associated
               specifically with switching from a previously performed task. Two
               candidate aspects were: (i) that performance required a physical
               response and (ii) that the two tasks shared their responses (they
               had bivalent response mappings). The present study therefore
               compared three separate groups to explore the effects of these
               different aspects of performance. Each group completed the same
               basic task-switching paradigm, but with either an overt response
               or covert response, and either switching between tasks that
               shared their responses (bivalent response mappings) or had
               separate responses (univalent response mappings). When comparing
               precue-locked ERPs, we observed three separable components: one
               common to all three groups, one which primarily dissociated overt
               from covert responding, and one which primarily dissociated
               bivalent from univalent responding. We therefore concluded that
               changing our behavior engages at least three dissociable
               mechanisms. Interestingly, in the overt conditions, residual
               switch-costs were absent; in addition, therefore, we concluded
               that it is possible to engage cognitive control in advance, such
               that the new behavior is as efficient as were the subject to have
               repeated the old behavior.},

	abstract = {AbstractStudies investigating language commonly isolate one
               modality or process, focusing on comprehension or production.
               Here, we present a framework for a paradigm that combines both:
               the Concise Language Paradigm (CLaP), tapping into comprehension
               and production within one trial. The trial structure is identical
               across conditions, presenting a sentence followed by a picture to
               be named. We tested 21 healthy speakers with EEG to examine three
               time periods during a trial (sentence, pre-picture interval,
               picture onset), yielding contrasts of sentence comprehension,
               contextually and visually guided word retrieval, object
               recognition, and naming. In the CLaP, sentences are presented
               auditorily (constrained, unconstrained, reversed), and pictures
               appear as normal (constrained, unconstrained, bare) or scrambled
               objects. Imaging results revealed different evoked responses
               after sentence onset for normal and time-reversed speech.
               Further, we replicated the context effect of alpha-beta power
               decreases before picture onset for constrained relative to
               unconstrained sentences, and could clarify that this effect
               arises from power decreases following constrained sentences.
               Brain responses locked to picture-onset differed as a function of
               sentence context and picture type (normal vs. scrambled), and
               naming times were fastest for pictures in constrained sentences,
               followed by scrambled picture naming, and equally fast for bare
               and unconstrained picture naming. Finally, we also discuss the
               potential of the CLaP to be adapted to different focuses, using
               different versions of the linguistic content and tasks, in
               combination with electrophysiology or other imaging methods.
               These first results of the CLaP indicate that this paradigm
               offers a promising framework to investigate the language system.},

               have received considerable attention, little is yet known about
               how people choose what to do next in ill‐defined tasks. In this
               contribution, we shed light on this issue by considering everyday
               tasks, which in many cases have a multitude of possible solutions
               (e.g., it does not matter in which order the items are brought to
               the table when setting a table) and are thus categorized as
               ill‐defined problems. Even if there are no hard constraints on
               the ordering of subtasks in everyday activities, our research
               shows that people exhibit specific preferences. We propose that
               these preferences arise from bounded rationality, that is, people
               only have limited knowledge and processing power available, which
               results in a preference to minimize the overall physical and

               be achieved by (a) taking properties of the spatial environment
               into account to use them to one's advantage, and (b) employing a

               widely used as an implicit measure for the sense of agency. The
               debate remains unsettled primarily because the experimental
               conditions used in previous studies were confounded with various
               alternative causes for temporal compression, and action intention
               has not yet been tested comprehensively against all potential
               alternative causes in a single study. Here, we solve this puzzle
               by jointly comparing participants' estimates of the interval
               between three types of triggering events with comparable
               predictability-voluntary movement, passive movement, and external
               sensory event-and an external sensory outcome (auditory or visual
               across experiments). The results failed to show intentional
               binding, that is, no shorter interval estimation for the
               voluntary than the passive movement conditions. Instead, we
               observed temporal (but not intentional) binding when comparing
               both movement conditions with the external sensory condition.
               Thus, temporal binding appears to originate from sensory
               integration and temporal prediction, not from action intention.
               As such, these findings underscore the need to reconsider the use
               of ``intentional binding'' as a reliable proxy of the sense of
               agency. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights

               packaging and ordering of events in speech. These differences
               affect the representation of events in co‐speech
               gesture----gesturing with speech----but not in silent
               gesture----gesturing without speech. Here we examine when in
               development blind children begin to show adult‐like patterns in
               co‐speech and silent gesture. We studied speech and gestures
               produced by 30 blind and 30 sighted children learning Turkish,
               equally divided into 3 age groups: 5--6, 7--8, 9--10 years. The
               children were asked to describe three‐dimensional spatial event
               scenes (e.g., running out of a house) first with speech, and then
               without speech using only their hands. We focused on physical
               motion events, which, in blind adults, elicit cross‐linguistic
               differences in speech and co‐speech gesture, but cross‐linguistic
               similarities in silent gesture. Our results showed an effect of
               language on gesture when it was accompanied by speech (co‐speech
               gesture), but not when it was used without speech (silent
               gesture) across both blind and sighted learners. The
               language‐specific co‐speech gesture pattern for both packaging
               and ordering semantic elements was present at the earliest ages
               we tested the blind and sighted children. The silent gesture
               pattern appeared later for blind children than sighted children
               for both packaging and ordering. Our findings highlight gesture
               as a robust and integral aspect of the language acquisition
               process at the early ages and provide insight into when language
               does and does not have an effect on gesture, even in blind
               children who lack visual access to gesture.Research Highlights
               Gestures, when produced with speech (i.e., co‐speech gesture),
               follow language‐specific patterns in event representation in both
               blind and sighted children. Gestures, when produced without
               speech (i.e., silent gesture), do not follow the
               language‐specific patterns in event representation in both blind
               and sighted children. Language‐specific patterns in speech and
               co‐speech gestures are observable at the same time in blind and
               sighted children. The cross‐linguistic similarities in silent
               gestures begin slightly later in blind children than in sighted
               children.},

	abstract = {When performing movements in rapid succession, the brain needs to
               coordinate ongoing execution with the preparation of an upcoming
               action. Here we identify the processes and brain areas involved
               in this ability of online preparation. Human participants (both
               male and female) performed pairs of single-finger presses or
               three-finger chords in rapid succession while 7T fMRI was
               recorded. In the overlap condition, they could prepare the second
               movement during the first response, in the non-overlap condition
               only after the first response was completed. Despite matched
               perceptual and movement requirements, fMRI revealed increased
               brain activity in the overlap condition in regions along the
               intra-parietal sulcus and ventral visual stream. Multivariate
               analyses suggested that these areas are involved in stimulus
               identification and action selection. In contrast, the dorsal
               premotor cortex, known to be involved in planning upcoming
               movements, showed no discernible signs of heightened activity.
               This observation suggests that the bottleneck during simultaneous
               action execution and preparation arises at the level of stimulus
               identification and action selection, whereas movement planning in
               the premotor cortex can unfold concurrently with the execution of
               a current action without requiring additional neural
               activity.Significance StatementThe brain's ability to select and
               plan upcoming actions while controlling ongoing movements is a
               crucial evolutionary adaptation of the action system. However,
               the neural basis of online action preparation remains largely
               unknown. We found that superior-parietal and occipito-temporal
               areas exhibited heightened activation during online preparation.
               Surprisingly, the dorsal premotor cortex, known to be a crucial
               structure in motor planning, did not display additional
               activation during online preparation. These findings imply that
               while motor planning within the premotor cortex can occur in
               parallel with the execution of ongoing movement, stimulus
               identification and action selection in the posterior parietal
               cortex constitute a bottleneck for online action preparation.},

               action plans is due to selection demands imposed on working
               memory. Individuals with low and high working memory spans
               learned arbitrary motor actions in response to two different
               visual events (A and B), presented in a serial order. They
               planned a response to the first event (A) and while maintaining
               this action plan in memory they then executed a speeded response
               to the second event (B). Afterward, they executed the action plan
               for the first event (A) maintained in memory. Speeded responses
               to the second event (B) were delayed when it shared an action
               feature (feature overlap) with the first event (A), relative to
               when it did not (no feature overlap). The size of the
               feature-overlap delay was greater for low-span than for high-span
               participants. This indicates that interference due to overlapping
               action plans is greater when fewer working memory resources are
               available, suggesting that this interference is due to selection

               important role in managing current and upcoming action plans, at
               least for newly learned tasks. Also, managing multiple action

               action retained in working memory. Retaining an action plan in
               working memory (WM) can delay or facilitate the execution of an
               intervening action when the action features of the two action
               plans partly overlap (partial repetition) compared to when they
               do not overlap. We investigated whether partial repetition costs
               (PRCs) or benefits (PRBs) occur when the intervening event is an
               ideomotor-compatible stimulus that is a biological representation
               of the response required by the participant. Participants viewed
               two visual events and retained an action plan to the first event
               (A) while executing a speeded response to the second, intervening
               event (B). In Experiment 1A, the two visual events were ideomotor
               compatible, non-ideomotor compatible (abstract), or one was
               ideomotor compatible, and the other abstract. Results showed PRCs
               for all event A-B stimulus combinations with reduced PRCs for
               intervening, ideomotor compatible events. In contrast to previous
               research, there was no evidence that ideomotor-compatible actions
               were automatic and bypassed the selection bottleneck. Experiment
               1B confirmed PRCs for ideomotor compatible stimuli that more
               accurately mimicked the required response. Findings suggest that
               mechanisms for activating, selecting, and retaining action plans
               are similar between ideomotor compatible and abstract visual
               events. We conclude that PRCs occur in response to intervening
               events when action plans are generated offline and rely on WM,
               including those for ideomotor-compatible stimuli; but PRBs may be
               restricted to actions generated online. This conclusion is

               postulated core processes, namely feature binding and retrieval.
               Action control is an important topic as humans interact with
               their environment by means of goal-directed behavior, i.e. by
               means of actions. Cognitive processes were developed and shaped
               to enhance preparation, execution, and regulation of action.
               Therefore, it is the current consensus that cognition serves
               action. To date, research on human action control is comprised
               mainly of an abundance of paradigm-specific results and models.
               To gain a better understanding of action control, an integrative
               framework was proposed (the BRAC framework - for Binding and
               Retrieval in Action Control, Frings et al., 2020) that can
               explain a wide range of findings across different experimental
               paradigms by assuming two core processes as key functions in
               action control: feature binding and feature retrieval. In this
               special collection, 20 articles present and discuss different
               types of sequential paradigms in terms of this integrative
               account. This editorial explains the major assumptions of the

	abstract = {Response inhibition is an important act of control in many
               domains of psychology and neuroscience. It is often studied in a
               stop-signal task that requires subjects to inhibit an ongoing
               action in response to a stop signal. Performance in the
               stop-signal task is understood as a race between a go process
               that underlies the action and a stop process that inhibits the
               action. Responses are inhibited if the stop process finishes
               before the go process. The finishing time of the stop process is
               not directly observable; a mathematical model is required to
               estimate its duration. Logan and Cowan (1984) developed an
               independent race model that is widely used for this purpose. We
               present a general race model that extends the independent race
               model to account for the role of choice in go and stop processes,
               and a special race model that assumes each runner is a stochastic
               accumulator governed by a diffusion process. We apply the models
               to 2 data sets to test assumptions about selective influence of
               capacity limitations on drift rates and strategies on thresholds,
               which are largely confirmed. The model provides estimates of
               distributions of stop-signal response times, which previous
               models could not estimate. We discuss implications of viewing
               cognitive control as the result of a repertoire of acts of
               control tailored to different tasks and situations.},

               presented with a stop signal (a tone) that told them not to
               respond on that trial. The major dependent variables were (a) the

              cognitive distraction. While different varieties of unexpected
              events have been studied largely independently, and many different

              and is posited to project to the subthalamic nucleus, with a

               performed two inhibition tasks while lying in the scanner: the

               have different views on these monitoring subsystems. While the
               error detection model proposes a specific error detection system,
               the response competition model denies the necessity of a specific
               error detector and favors a more general unitary system
               evaluating response conflict. Both models suggest that the
               frontomedian wall in the vicinity of the anterior cingulate
               sulcus plays an important role in performance monitoring. The
               present study investigates the hemodynamic and
               electrophysiological correlates of response competition and error
               processing. Twelve young healthy participants performed a
               speeded, modified flanker task, while fMRI signals and ERPs were
               measured in separate sessions. The event-related fMRI shows that
               networks involving the frontomedian wall are activated during
               both response competition and error processing. However, an
               anatomical dissociation was found: while error processing
               preferentially activates the human homologue of the cingulate
               motor area (CMA, BA 24c') in the depth of the anterior cingulate
               sulcus, response competition is accompanied by activation of the
               pre-SMA and mesial BA 8. The ERP waveforms for erroneous trials
               exhibit a large error-related negativity, which is most likely
               generated in the CMA. These results suggest that the CMA plays a

               to the means by which mental life is translated into physical
               behavior. Why this is so was the topic of a 2005 American
               Psychologist article whose main title was ``The Cinderella of
               Psychology.'' In the present article, we briefly review some of
               the reasons why motor control was relegated to the sidelines of
               psychology. Then we point to work showing that experimental
               psychologists have much to contribute to research on action
               generation. We focus on studies showing that actions are
               generated in a way that, at least by default, minimize changes
               between successive actions. The method is computationally as well
               as physically economical but also requires consideration of
               costs, including costs of different kinds. How such costs are
               compared is discussed in the next section. The final section
               offers comments about the future of psychologically focused
               action research. Two additional themes of the review concern
               methods for studying action generation. First, much can be
               learned through naturalistic observation. Second, subsequent
               experiments, designed to check naturalistic observations, can use
               very simple equipment and procedures. This can make the study of
               action generation easy to pursue in the psychology laboratory.},

               the selection of coordinated motion patterns, especially in
               reaching tasks. The central idea is that when a spatial target is
               selected as an object to be reached, stored postures are
               evaluated for the contributions they can make to the task.
               Weights are assigned to the stored postures, and a single target
               posture is found by taking a weighted sum of the stored postures.
               Movement is achieved by reducing the distance between the
               starting angle and target angle of each joint. The model explains

               contemporary model of attention holds that there are two separate
               types of processes that operate concurrently: a flexible but
               resource-limited control process that regulates the contents of
               conscious awareness, and a relatively inflexible automatic
               process that can attract attention to stimuli without conscious
               intent. Passive automatic processes, can either facilitate or
               inhibit active attentional processing, necessitating either less
               or more attentional effort, depending on the characteristics of
               the information that is currently present. On a dichotic
               listening task in which subjects attended to or ignored

               channel, relative to neutral words. This differential capacity

              hand, they use it to say what they want to convey to others (or to
              themselves). In either case, they need to assemble the structure
              of sentences in a systematic fashion, in accordance with the
              grammar of their language. Despite the fact that the structures
              that comprehenders and speakers assemble are systematic in an
              identical fashion (i.e., obey the same grammatical constraints),
              the two `modes' of assembling sentence structures might or might
              not be performed by the same cognitive mechanisms. Currently, the
              field of psycholinguistics implicitly adopts the position that
              they are supported by different cognitive mechanisms, as evident
              from the fact that most psycholinguistic models seek to explain
              either comprehension or production phenomena. The potential

               such priming as a tool to probe the architecture for processing
               the syntactic features of written words. We studied the impact of
               masked and unmasked written word primes on response times to a
               subsequent visible target that shared or did not share syntactic
               features such as grammatical category and grammatical number.
               Methodological precautions included the use of distinct lists of
               subliminal primes that were never consciously seen, and the
               verification that participants were at chance in a
               prime-classification task. Across five experiments, subliminal
               priming could be induced by the repetition of the same
               grammatical category (e.g. a noun followed by another noun), by
               the transition between two categories (e.g. a determiner followed
               by a noun), or by the repetition of a single grammatical feature,
               even if syntax is violated (e.g. ``they lemons'', where the
               expression is ungrammatical but the plural feature is repeated).
               The orthographic endings of prime words also provided unconscious
               cues to their grammatical category. Those results indicate the

               connector nodes is for between-module communication remains
               underspecified. Here, we use a network model of the brain derived
               from resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data and investigate
               the modular functional architecture of the human brain by
               analyzing activity at different types of nodes in the network
               across 9,208 experiments of 77 cognitive tasks in the BrainMap
               database. Using an author-topic model of cognitive functions, we
               find a strong spatial correspondence between the cognitive
               functions and the network's modules, suggesting that each module
               performs a discrete cognitive function. Crucially, activity at
               local nodes within the modules does not increase in tasks that
               require more cognitive functions, demonstrating the autonomy of
               modules' functions. However, connector nodes do exhibit increased
               activity when more cognitive functions are engaged in a task.
               Moreover, connector nodes are located where brain activity is
               associated with many different cognitive functions. Connector
               nodes potentially play a role in between-module communication
               that maintains the modular function of the brain. Together, these

               expectancy. Interval schedules of feedback have been shown to
               generate habits, as revealed by the insensitivity of behaviour
               acquired under this schedule to outcome devaluation treatments.
               Two experiments were conducted to assess the role of the
               dorsolateral striatum in habit learning. In Experiment 1, sham
               operated controls and rats with dorsolateral striatum lesions
               were trained to press a lever for sucrose under interval
               schedules. After training, the sucrose was devalued by inducing
               taste aversion to it using lithium chloride, whereas saline
               injections were given to the controls. Only rats given the
               devaluation treatment reduced their consumption of sucrose and
               this reduction was similar in both the sham and the lesioned
               groups. All rats were then returned to the instrumental chamber
               for an extinction test, in which the lever was extended but no
               sucrose was delivered. In contrast to sham operated controls,
               rats with dorsolateral striatum lesions refrained from pressing
               the lever if the outcome was devalued. To assess the specificity
               of the role of dorsolateral striatum in this effect a second
               experiment was conducted in which a group with lesions of
               dorsomedial striatum was added. In relation now to both the sham
               and the dorsomedial lesioned groups, only rats with lesions of
               dorsolateral striatum significantly reduced responding after
               outcome devaluation. In conclusion, this study provides direct
               evidence that the dorsolateral striatum is necessary for habit
               formation. Furthermore, it suggests that, when the habit system
               is disrupted, control over instrumental performance reverts to
               the system controlling the performance of goal-directed
               instrumental actions.},

               tested after training using a variety of behavioural assays that
               have been established to detect action-outcome learning. In

               the sensitivity of rats' instrumental performance to both outcome
               devaluation and contingency degradation when tested in
               extinction, whereas lesions of the anterior DMS had no effect. In

               is minimally affected by other ongoing tasks. The neural basis of
               automaticity was examined by testing subjects in a serial
               reaction time (SRT) task under both single-task and dual-task
               conditions. The diminishing cost of dual-task performance was
               used as an index for automaticity. Subjects performed the SRT
               task during two functional magnetic imaging sessions separated by
               3 h of behavioral training over multiple days. Behavioral data
               showed that, by the end of testing, subjects had automated

               performance of the SRT task concurrently with the secondary task
               elicited activation in a wide network of frontal and striatal
               regions, as well as parietal lobe. After extensive behavioral

               activity in bilateral ventral premotor regions, right middle

               progressive subversion by addictive drugs of striatum-dependent
               operant and Pavlovian learning mechanisms that are usually
               involved in the control over behaviour by stimuli associated with
               natural reinforcement. Although mainly organized through
               segregated parallel cortico-striato-pallido-thalamo-cortical
               loops involved in motor or emotional functions, the basal
               ganglia, and especially the striatum, are key mediators of the
               modulation of behavioural responses, under the control of both
               action-outcome and stimulus-response mechanisms, by incentive
               motivational processes and Pavlovian associations. Here we
               suggest that protracted exposure to addictive drugs recruits
               serial and dopamine-dependent, striato-nigro-striatal ascending
               spirals from the nucleus accumbens to more dorsal regions of the
               striatum that underlie a shift from action-outcome to
               stimulus-response mechanisms in the control over drug seeking.
               When this progressive ventral to dorsal striatum shift is
               combined with drug-associated Pavlovian influences from limbic

               This instantiation of implicit sub-cortical processing of
               drug-associated stimuli and instrumental responding might be a
               key mechanism underlying the development of compulsive drug

	abstract = {Previous work has amply demonstrated divided attention ``costs''
               both in single-task multistimulus visual processing and in
               performance of multiple simple tasks; however, the relationship
               between the two has not been clarified. This article postulates
               two distinct causes: (1) visual processes that commence without
               delays and proceed simultaneously, but show lingering mutual
               interference dependent upon complexity, and (2) discrete queueing
               of the response selection stage. The first has resource-like
               properties, while the second has bottleneck-like properties.
               Either or both can generate performance costs observed in any
               particular situation, accounting for a variety of previous
               results. To test this theory, the effects of stimulus onset
               asynchrony (SOA) on accuracy and speed in performing dual choice
               tasks were examined. The first two experiments involved a choice
               response to a tone as a first task, and a second task requiring
               complex perceptual decisions (digit identification or conjunction
               search) with masked displays and unspeeded second responses.
               Reducing the SOA had negligible effects upon second-task
               accuracy, and performance in the two tasks was virtually
               independent. However, when speeded manual (Exp. 3) or vocal (Exp.
               4) responses were required on the same second task, dramatic
               interference was observed, with strong positive dependencies
               between reaction times (RTs) on the two tasks. When both tasks
               involved complex visual displays, SOA reductions produced
               dramatic interference, but no dependencies between performance,
               whether the first task involved a speeded (Exp. 5) or unspeeded
               (Exp. 6) response. The results reject pure late-selection
               accounts and general capacity sharing models, and support the
               two-component theory. They also suggest that standard use of the
               term ``attention,'' suggesting a single resource or mechanism, is
               highly misleading.},

               this book The renowned philosopher Jerry Fodor, who has been a
               leading figure in the study of the mind for more than twenty
               years, presents a strikingly original theory of the basic
               constituents of thought. He suggests that the heart of a
               cognitive science is its theory of concepts, and thatcognitive
               scientists have gone badly wrong in many areas because their
               assumptions about concepts have been seriously mistaken. Fodor
               argues compellingly for an atomistic theory of concepts, deals
               out witty and pugnacious demolitions of the rival theories that
               have prevailed in recent years, andsuggests that future work on
               human cognition should build upon new foundations. This lively,
               conversational, accessible book is the first volume in the Oxford

               views have been discussed, his views about the nature of the mind
               and the place of psychology within modem science have received
               less attention. In particular,there has been little discussion of
               what I will call ``Russell's flirtation with behaviorism.''
               Although some individuals have mentioned this phase in Russell's
               philosophical career, they have not adequately situated it within
               Russell's changing philosophical views, in particular, his
               naturalistic epistemology. I briefly discuss this naturalistic
               epistemology and the kind of behaviorism it resulted in. I also
               briefly compare it to the behaviorism of John Watson, which had a
               strong influence on Russell. Russell finally abandoned this
               extreme form of behaviorism because of its denial of mental
               images, which was crucial to Russell's philosophy of mind and his
               semantics. I suggest that even though Russell's flirtation with
               behaviorism came to an end, he continued to be committed to a
               naturalistic epistemology. If this is so, we need to reassess the

               Processing and Cognition: The Loyola Symposium, (pp.55-85), 1975,
               Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates (see record
               1975-30974-000). To what extent are our conscious intentions and
               strategies in control of the way information is processed in our
               minds? This seems to be a question of importance to us both as
               psychologists and as human beings. Yet as Shallice (1972) has
               pointed out, most theorists in psychology have avoided
               consideration of the relationship between conscious and
               unconscious mental events. While psychological writers rarely
               deal with this distinction directly, the reader of psychological
               publications can hardly avoid it. On the one hand, the pages of
               journals are full of studies in which the ``strategies'' or
               ``optional processes'' of the subject are used to explain the
               results obtained; on the other hand, we are told that human
               memory is an associational machine that operates entirely without
               control of the subjects' strategies (Anderson \& Bower, 1973).
               Both of these views need to be accommodated. Even the most
               cognitive of theorists recognizes that people are not always able
               to adapt their thought processes to the strategies required by
               the task, and Anderson and Bower (1973) explicitly recognize that
               their strategy-free memory system must be coupled to other
               strategy-dependent systems. In this paper we review studies
               designed to provide some experimental analysis of how conscious
               strategies interact with automatic activation processes to
               determine performance. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA,

               (1997) exemplar-based random walk (EBRW) as the theory of

               dual-task performance. Among others, these practice effects are
               attributed to an optimization of executive function skills that

	abstract = {AbstractThis paper presents rational inattention as a new,
               transdiagnostic theory of information seeking in
               neurodevelopmental conditions that have uneven cognitive and
               socio‐emotional profiles, including developmental language
               disorder (DLD), dyslexia, dyscalculia and autism. Rational
               inattention holds that the optimal solution to minimizing
               epistemic uncertainty is to avoid imprecise information sources.
               The key theoretical contribution of this report is to endogenize
               imprecision, making it a function of the primary neurocognitive
               difficulties that have been invoked to explain neurodivergent
               phenotypes, including deficits in auditory perception, working
               memory, procedural learning and the social brain network. We
               argue that disengagement with information sources with low
               endogenous precision (e.g. speech in DLD, orthography‐phonology
               mappings in dyslexia, numeric stimuli in dyscalculia and social
               signals in autism) constitutes resource‐rational behaviour. We
               demonstrate the strength of this account in a series of
               computational simulations. In experiment 1, we simulate
               information seeking in artificial agents mimicking an array of
               neurodivergent phenotypes, which optimally explore a complex
               learning environment containing speech, text, numeric stimuli and
               social cues. In experiment 2, we simulate optimal information
               seeking in a cross‐modal dual‐task paradigm and qualitatively
               replicate empirical data from children with and without DLD.
               Across experiments, simulated agents' only aim was to maximally
               reduce epistemic uncertainty, with no difference in reward across
               information sources. We show that rational inattention emerges
               naturally in specific neurodivergent phenotypes as a function of
               low endogenous precision. For instance, an agent mimicking the
               DLD phenotype disengages with speech (and preferentially engages
               with alternative precise information sources) because endogenous
               imprecision renders speech not conducive to information gain.
               Because engagement is necessary for learning, simulation
               demonstrates how optimal information seeking may paradoxically
               contribute negatively to an already delayed learning trajectory
               in neurodivergent children.Research Highlights We present the
               first comprehensive theory of information seeking in
               neurodivergent children to date, centred on the notion of
               rational inattention. We demonstrate the strength of this account
               in a series of computational simulations involving artificial
               agents mimicking specific neurodivergent phenotypes that
               optimally explore a complex learning environment containing
               speech, text, numeric stimuli, and social cues. We show how
               optimal information seeking may, paradoxically, contribute
               negatively to an already delayed learning trajectory in
               neurodivergent children. This report advances our understanding
               of the factors shaping short‐term decision making and long‐term

               time course for response initiation and response inhibition.
               However, the exact time course varies widely depending on
               experimental conditions, including the frequency of different
               trial types and the urgency to respond. For example, in the
               stop-signal task, where both action initiation and action
               inhibition are involved and could be compared, action inhibition
               is typically found to be much faster. However, this apparent
               difference is likely due to there being much greater urgency to
               inhibit an action than to initiate one in order to avoid failing
               at the task. This asymmetry in the urgency between action
               initiation and action inhibition makes it impossible to compare
               their relative time courses in a single task. Here, we
               demonstrate that, when action initiation and action inhibition
               are measured separately under conditions that are matched as
               closely as possible, their speeds are not distinguishable and
               positively correlated across participants. Our results raise the
               possibility that action initiation and action inhibition may not
               necessarily be qualitatively distinct processes, but may instead
               reflect complementary outcomes of a single decision process
               determining whether or not to act.},

	abstract = {AbstractValue-based decision-making often occurs in multitasking
               scenarios relying on both cognitive and motor processes. Yet,
               laboratory experiments often isolate these processes, thereby
               neglecting potential interactions. This isolated approach reveals
               a dichotomy: the cognitive process by which reward influences
               decision-making is capacity-limited, whereas the influence of
               motor cost is free of such constraints. If true, dual-tasking
               should predominantly impair reward processing but not affect the
               impact of motor costs. To test this hypothesis, we designed a
               decision-making task in which participants made choices to walk
               toward targets for rewards while navigating past an obstacle. The
               motor cost to reach these rewards varied in real-time.
               Participants either solely performed the decision-making task, or
               additionally performed a secondary pitch-recall task. Results
               revealed that while both reward and motor costs influenced
               decision-making, the secondary task did not affect these factors.
               Instead, dual-tasking slowed down participants' walking, thereby
               reducing the overall reward rate. Hence, contrary to the
               prediction that the added cognitive demand would affect the
               weighing of reward or motor cost differentially, these processes
               seem to be maintained at the expense of slowing down the motor
               system. This slowdown may be indicative of interference at the
               locomotor level, thereby underpinning motor-cognitive
               interactions during decision-making.},

               stimulus triggers only the preparation of a response, without
               necessarily triggering its initiation. Critically, this would
               allow a habit to exist without ever being overtly expressed, if
               the prepared habitual response is replaced by a goal-directed
               alternative before it can be initiated. Consistent with this
               hypothesis, we show that limiting the time available for response
               preparation4,5 can unmask latent habits. Participants practiced a
               visuomotor association for 4 days, after which the association

               neural centers, exhibiting a certain degree of coordination in
               finger motions. This coordination enhances the flexibility and
               efficiency of professional pianists' keystrokes. Research on the
               coordination of keystrokes in professional pianists is of great
               significance for guiding the movements of piano beginners and the
               motion planning of exoskeleton robots, among other fields.
               Currently, research on the coordination of multi-finger piano
               keystroke actions is still in its infancy. Scholars primarily
               focus on phenomenological analysis and theoretical description,
               which lack accurate and practical modeling methods. Considering
               that the tendon of the ring finger is closely connected to
               adjacent fingers, resulting in limited flexibility in its
               movement, this study concentrates on coordinated keystrokes
               involving the middle and ring fingers. A motion measurement
               platform is constructed, and Leap Motion is used to collect data
               from 12 professional pianists. A universal model applicable to
               multiple individuals for multi-finger coordination in keystroke
               actions based on the backpropagation (BP) neural network is
               proposed, which is optimized using a genetic algorithm (GA) and a
               sparrow search algorithm (SSA). The angular rotation of the ring
               finger's MCP joint is selected as the model output, while the
               individual difference information and the angular data of the
               middle finger's MCP joint serve as inputs. The individual
               difference information used in this study includes ring finger
               length, middle finger length, and years of piano training. The
               results indicate that the proposed SSA-BP neural network-based
               model demonstrates superior predictive accuracy, with a root mean
               square error of 4.8328$\,^{\circ}$. Based on this model, the keystroke
               motion of the ring finger's MCP joint can be accurately predicted
               from the middle finger's keystroke motion information, offering

               preactivated Task 2 (T2) response information influences Task 1
               (T1) response selection, a phenomenon known as the backward
               crosstalk effect (BCE). Current models of the BCE implicitly
               assume that T2 response information is equally present in trials
               requiring compatible or incompatible responses, such that T1
               performance improves when T2 requires a compatible response and
               deteriorates when T2 requires an incompatible response. Thus, T2
               response information should have a facilitatory and an
               interfering effect on T1. Interestingly, this hypothesis has
               never been tested, and the present study (conducted between 2021
               and 2023) attempts to fill this gap by using neutral trials in
               which T2 responses did not spatially overlap with those in T1.
               The results suggest that the BCE (in T1) reflects both

               thus corroborating current conceptualizations of the BCE. We also
               observed an unexpected pattern of effects for T2, with only an
               interference effect, but no facilitation effect. Additional
               experiments led us to conclude that the T2 result was sensitive
               to the specific task characteristics. Conclusions about how the

               historically undervalued in social cognition and social
               neuroscience research. We suggest much of social cognition can be
               characterized as specialized feature representations supported by
               domain‐general cognitive control systems. To test this proposal,
               we develop a comprehensive working model, based on an interactive
               activation and competition architecture and applied to the
               control of action. As such, we label the model ``ICON''
               (interactive activation and competition model for the control of
               action). We used the ICON model to simulate human performance
               across various laboratory tasks. Our simulations emphasize that
               many laboratory‐based social tasks do not require socially
               specific control systems, such as those that are argued to rely
               on neural networks associated with theory‐of‐mind. Moreover, our

               cognition, can stem from deficits in social representation
               instead. We advocate for a ``default stance'' in social cognition,
               where control is usually general, but representation is specific.

               psychological models of typing are, to a large extent, divorced

               unanswered many questions regarding the cognitive architecture of
               typing. In this article we advocate the use of a psycholinguistic
               framework for studying typing, by showing that such a framework
               could reveal important similarities and differences between
               spoken and typed production. Specifically, we investigated the
               interaction between the lexical and postlexical layers by using a
               phenomenon known in spoken production as the ``repeated-phoneme
               effect.'' Participants typed four-word sequences of
               ``finger-twisters'' (equivalent to tongue-twisters in spoken
               production), in which the vowel in the last two words was either
               repeated (e.g., ``fog top'') or not (e.g., ``fog tip''). We found
               reliably more migration errors between the consonants of the two
               typed words when the vowel was repeated, even after the effect of
               phonology was accounted for. This finding is compatible with an
               interactive typing system in which postlexical representations
               send feedback to lexical representations and reveals similar
               dynamics between spoken and typed production. Additional analyses
               showed further similarities to spoken production, such as
               distinct lexical and postlexical error categories, but also
               revealed that typing errors were much more likely than spoken
               errors to violate phonotactic constraints. These results provide
               the first demonstration of feedback between the postlexical and
               lexical layers in typing, and more generally demonstrate the

               Gelder's (1998) ``dynamical hypothesis.'' In that paper, van Gelder
               proposed that cognitive agents were not digital computers---per the
               representational computational approach---but dynamical systems.
               The evolution of the dynamical hypothesis was driven by parallel
               advances in three areas. Theoretically, a deeper understanding of
               genetics, biology, neuroscience, and cognitive science inspired
               questions about how systems within each domain dynamically
               interact and extend their effects across spatiotemporal scales.
               Methodologically, more sophisticated and domain‐general tools
               allowed researchers to discover, model, and quantify system
               dynamics, structure, and patterns across multiple scales to
               generate a more comprehensive system‐level understanding of
               behaviors. Empirically, we can analyze a system's behavior while
               preserving its natural dynamics, revealing evidence that the
               reductionist approach leads to an incomplete understanding of the
               components and the overall system. Researchers have traditionally
               reduced a complex system into its component processes and assumed
               that the parts can be recombined to explain the whole. These
               three advances fundamentally altered our understanding of a
               ``cognitive agent:'' How their behaviors are driven by long‐range
               coordination across multiple processes, how the interdependent
               and nested structure of interacting variables produces behaviors
               that are greater than the sum of its parts, and how environmental
               constraints shape adaptive yet stable behavioral patterns.},

	abstract = {Before children learn the specific meanings of numerals like six,
               do they know that they represent precise quantities? Previous
               studies have reported conflicting evidence and have found that
               children expect numerals to label precise quantities in some
               tasks but not in others (Condry \& Spelke, 2008; Sarnecka \&
               Gelman, 2004). In this article, we present evidence that some of
               children's apparent successes are best explained not by
               domain-specific semantic understanding of number but instead by
               language-general pragmatic abilities. In Experiment 1, we
               replicated the findings of the previous studies in a
               within-subject design. When 3-year-olds saw a set labeled with a
               number (e.g., five) and an item was added, they preferred a new
               label (six) over the old one, as though they believed that number
               words have precise meanings. However, when 1 of 2 sets was
               labeled (e.g., as five) and children were asked to find the same
               quantity (five) or a new quantity (six), they performed
               identically whether the original set was changed in quantity or
               merely rearranged. Thus, when 2 numerals were offered as
               alternative labels for 1 set, children behaved as though they had
               precise meanings, whereas when they were asked to determine which
               of 2 sets a single numeral referred to, they did not. In
               Experiment 2, children were tested using similar methods but with
               novel nouns and objects that were transformed, instead of sets.
               Children showed the identical pattern of results despite lacking
               meanings for these words, suggesting that their judgments for
               numerals may not have relied on semantic knowledge that numerals
               have precise meanings. We propose that children's behavior can be
               explained by the use of domain-general pragmatic inference and
               does not require positing domain-specific numerical knowledge.},

               natural number n has a successor n + 1 - by learning the
               productive linguistic rules that govern verbal counting. Previous
               studies report that speakers of languages with less complex count
               list morphology have greater counting and mathematical knowledge
               at earlier ages in comparison to speakers of more complex
               languages (e.g., Miller \& Stigler, 1987). Here, we tested
               whether differences in count list transparency affected
               children's acquisition of the successor function in three
               languages with relatively transparent count lists (Cantonese,
               Slovenian, and English) and two languages with relatively opaque
               count lists (Hindi and Gujarati). We measured 3.5- to
               6.5-year-old children's mastery of their count list's recursive
               structure with two tasks assessing productive counting, which we
               then related to a measure of successor function knowledge. While
               the more opaque languages were associated with lower counting
               proficiency and successor function task performance in comparison
               to the more transparent languages, a unique within-language

               of productive counting and successor knowledge in almost every

               words in 84 children that were classified as ``cardinal-principle
               knowers'' by the criteria set forth by Wynn (1992). Results show
               that these children often do not know (1) which of two numbers in
               their count list denotes a greater quantity, and (2) that the
               difference between successive numbers in their count list is 1.
               Among counters, these abilities are predicted by the highest
               number to which they can count and their ability to estimate set
               sizes. Also, children's knowledge of the principles appears to be
               initially item-specific rather than general to all number words,
               and is most robust for very small numbers (e.g., 5) compared to

               learn to accurately count sets (i.e., become ``cardinal
               principle'' or ``CP'' knowers), they have a conceptual insight
               about how the count list implements the successor function -
               i.e., that every natural number n has a successor defined as n+1
               (Carey, 2004, 2009; Sarnecka \& Carey, 2008). However, recent
               studies suggest that knowledge of the successor function emerges
               sometime after children learn to accurately count, though it
               remains unknown when this occurs, and what causes this
               developmental transition. We tested knowledge of the successor
               function in 100 children aged 4 through 7 and asked how age and
               counting ability are related to: (1) children's ability to infer
               the successors of all numbers in their count list and (2)
               knowledge that all numbers have a successor. We found that
               children do not acquire these two facets of the successor

               2years after they learn to accurately count sets and become

               counting a set represents the size of the whole set) is a major
               milestone in early mathematics. But researchers disagree about
               the relationship between cardinal principle knowledge and other
               concepts, including how counting implements the successor
               function (for each number word N representing a cardinal value,
               the next word in the count list represents the cardinal value N +
               1) and exact ordering (cardinal values can be ordered such that
               each is one more than the value before it and one less than the
               value after it). No studies have investigated acquisition of the
               successor principle and exact ordering over time, and in relation
               to cardinal principle knowledge. An open question thus remains:
               Is the cardinal principle a ``gatekeeper'' concept children must
               acquire before learning about succession and exact ordering, or
               can these concepts develop separately? Preschoolers (N = 127) who
               knew the cardinal principle (CP-knowers) or who knew the cardinal
               meanings of number words up to ``three'' or ``four''
               (3-4-knowers) completed succession and exact ordering tasks at
               pretest and posttest. In between, children completed one of two
               trainings: counting only versus counting, cardinal labeling, and
               comparison. CP-knowers started out better than 3-4-knowers on
               succession and exact ordering. Controlling for this disparity, we
               found that CP-knowers improved over time on succession and exact
               ordering; 3-4-knowers did not. Improvement did not differ between
               the two training conditions. We conclude that children can learn
               the cardinal principle without understanding succession or exact
               ordering and hypothesize that children must understand the

               number word used in a count tells how many items there are (the
               cardinal word principle). In the first experiment, twenty-four 2-
               and 3-year-olds counted objects, actions, and sounds. Children
               counted objects best, but most showed some ability to generalize
               their counting to actions and sounds, suggesting that at a very
               young age, children begin to develop an abstract, generalizable
               mental representation of the counting routine. However, when
               asked ``how many'' following counting, only older children (mean
               age 3.6) gave the last number word used in the count a majority
               of the time, suggesting that the younger children did not
               understand the cardinal word principle. In the second experiment
               (the ``give-a-number'' task), the same children were asked to
               give a puppet one, two, three, five, and six items from a pile.
               The older children counted the items, showing a clear
               understanding of the cardinal word principle. The younger
               children succeeded only at giving one and sometimes two items,
               and never used counting to solve the task. A comparison of
               individual children's performance across the ``how-many'' and
               ``give-a-number'' tasks shows strong within-child consistency,
               indicating that children learn the cardinal word principle at
               roughly 3 1/2 years of age. In the third experiment, 18 2- and
               3-year-olds were asked several times for one, two, three, five,
               and six items, to determine the largest numerosity at which each
               child could succeed consistently. Results indicate that children
               learn the meanings of smaller number words before larger ones
               within their counting range, up to the number three or four. They
               then learn the cardinal word principle at roughly 3 1/2 years of
               age, and perform a general induction over this knowledge to
               acquire the meanings of all the number words within their
               counting range.},

               means knowing how counting relates to numbers (called the
               cardinal principle or cardinality); it means knowing that each
               number is generated by adding one to the previous number (called
               the successor function or succession), and it means knowing that
               all and only sets whose members can be placed in one-to-one

               understanding of succession for the numbers five and six. This

               psychological models of typing are, to a large extent, divorced
               from models of spoken language production. This gap has left
               unanswered many questions regarding the cognitive architecture of
               typing. In this article we advocate the use of a psycholinguistic
               framework for studying typing, by showing that such a framework
               could reveal important similarities and differences between
               spoken and typed production. Specifically, we investigated the
               interaction between the lexical and postlexical layers by using a
               phenomenon known in spoken production as the ``repeated-phoneme
               effect.'' Participants typed four-word sequences of
               ``finger-twisters'' (equivalent to tongue-twisters in spoken
               production), in which the vowel in the last two words was either
               repeated (e.g., ``fog top'') or not (e.g., ``fog tip''). We found
               reliably more migration errors between the consonants of the two
               typed words when the vowel was repeated, even after the effect of
               phonology was accounted for. This finding is compatible with an
               interactive typing system in which postlexical representations
               send feedback to lexical representations and reveals similar
               dynamics between spoken and typed production. Additional analyses
               showed further similarities to spoken production, such as
               distinct lexical and postlexical error categories, but also
               revealed that typing errors were much more likely than spoken
               errors to violate phonotactic constraints. These results provide
               the first demonstration of feedback between the postlexical and
               lexical layers in typing, and more generally demonstrate the
               utility of adopting a psycholinguistic framework tailored

	abstract = {Purpose: When vowel formants are externally perturbed, speakers
              change their production to oppose that perturbation both during
              the ongoing production (compensation) and in future productions
              (adaptation).. To date, attempts to explain the large variability
              across individuals in these responses have focused on trait-based
              characteristics such as auditory acuity, but evidence from other
              motor domains suggests that attention may modulate the motor
              response to sensory perturbations. Here, we test the extent to
              which attention impacts sensorimotor control for supralaryngeal
              articulation.Method: Neurobiologically healthy speakers were
              exposed to random (Experiment 1) or consistent (Experiment 2)
              real-time auditory perturbation of vowel formants to measure
              online compensation and trial-to-trial adaptation, respectively.
              In both experiments, participants completed two conditions: one
              with a simultaneous visual distractor task to divide attention,
              and one without this secondary task.Results: Divided attention
              slightly reduced online compensation, but only starting >300 ms
              after vowel onset, well beyond the typical duration of vowels in
              speech. Divided attention had no effect on adaptation.Conclusions:
              The results from both experiments suggest that the use of sensory
              feedback in typical speech motor control is a largely automatic
              process unaffected by attention, suggesting that the source of
              cross-speakers variability in response to formant perturbations
              likely lie within the speech production system rather than in
              higher-level cognitive processes. Methodologically, these results
              suggest that compensation for formant perturbations should be
              measured prior to 300ms after vowel onset to avoid any potential
              impact of attention or other higher-order cognitive factors.},

              does not to lead to overt execution? Global and effector-specific
              inhibitory mechanisms may be at play during imagined actions such
              as imagined typing. To test this hypothesis, we combined an
              experimental with a modelling approach. We conducted an experiment
              in which participants (N = 49) were asked to alternate between
              overt (executed) and covert (imagined) typing of unimanual words.
              We predicted that global motor inhibition should lead to longer

              an imagined vs. an executed trial. Effector-specific inhibition
              should amplify this effect when the same hand is used in
              successive trials. These predictions were borne out by movement
              times, but not by reaction times. We introduced and fitted an

              from this analysis suggest that motor inhibition may affect

              Here, we ask which properties of the group's interaction structure

              game paradigm in which directors instructed between one and five

               representations transform during this cascade of representations
               remains a matter of debate. Here, we studied the succession of
               neuronal representations in the primate prefrontal cortex (PFC).
               We trained monkeys to judge whether a pair of sequentially
               presented displays had the same number of items. We used a
               combination of single neuron and population-level analyses and
               discovered a sequential transformation of represented information

               represented with high precision and in conjunction with detailed
               information such as order, the decision was encoded in a
               low-dimensional subspace of neural activity. This decision

               evolved around us. What gives us an evolutionary advantage is
               working together to achieve common aims. Coordinating joint
               action begins at a tender age with such cooperative activities as
               alternating babbling and clapping games. Adult joint activities
               are far more complex and use multiple means of coordination.
               Joint action has attracted qualitative analyses by
               sociolinguists, cognitive scientists, and philosophers as well as
               empirical analyses and theories by cognitive scientists. Here, we
               analyze how joint action is spontaneously coordinated from start
               to finish in a novel complex real-life joint activity, assembling
               a piece of furniture, a task that captures the essentials of
               joint action, collaborators, things in the world, and
               communicative devices. Pairs of strangers assembled a TV cart
               from a stack of parts and a photo of the completed cart.
               Coordination prior to each assembly action was coded as explicit,
               using speech or gesture, or implicit, actions that both advanced
               the task and communicated the next step. Initial planning relied
               on explicit communication about structure, but not action nor
               division of labor, which were improvised. That served to
               establish a joint representation of the goal that informed
               actions and monitored progress. As assembly progressed,
               coordination was increasingly implicit, through actions alone.
               Joint action is a dynamic interplay of explicit and implicit
               signaling with respect to things in the world to coordinate
               ongoing progress, guided by a shared representation of the goal.},

               recently gaining renewed interest in biology, neuroscience, and
               cognitive science. Language and action are both combinatorial
               systems whose mode of combination has been argued to be
               hierarchical, combining elements into constituents of
               increasingly larger size. This structural similarity has led to
               the suggestion that they rely on shared cognitive and neural
               resources. In this article, we compare the conceptual and formal
               properties of hierarchy in language and action using set theory.
               We show that the strong compositionality of language requires a
               particular formalism, a magma, to describe the algebraic
               structure corresponding to the set of hierarchical structures
               underlying sentences. When this formalism is applied to actions,
               it appears to be both too strong and too weak. To overcome these
               limitations, which are related to the weak compositionality and
               sequential nature of action structures, we formalize the
               algebraic structure corresponding to the set of actions as a
               trace monoid. We aim to capture the different system properties
               of language and action in terms of the distinction between

               speaker turns are incredibly fast. These fast turn exchanges seem
               to involve next speakers predicting upcoming semantic
               information, such that next turn planning can begin before a
               current turn is complete. Given that face‐to‐face conversation
               also involves the use of communicative bodily signals, an
               important question is how bodily signals such as co‐speech hand
               gestures play into these processes of prediction and fast
               responding. In this corpus study, we found that hand gestures
               that depict or refer to semantic information started before the
               corresponding information in speech, which held both for the
               onset of the gesture as a whole, as well as the onset of the
               stroke (the most meaningful part of the gesture). This early
               timing potentially allows listeners to use the gestural
               information to predict the corresponding semantic information to
               be conveyed in speech. Moreover, we provided further evidence
               that questions with gestures got faster responses than questions
               without gestures. However, we found no evidence for the idea that
               how much a gesture precedes its lexical affiliate (i.e., its
               predictive potential) relates to how fast responses were given.
               The findings presented here highlight the importance of the

               presses in a fixed order yields memory representations (i.e.,
               motor chunks) that can be selected and used for sequence
               execution as if familiar key pressing sequences are single
               responses. In order to examine whether these motor chunks are
               robust in different situations and whether preparation for one
               sequence may overlap with execution of another one, two
               experiments were carried out in which participants executed two
               highly practiced keying sequences in rapid succession in response
               to two simultaneously presented stimuli. The results confirmed
               robustness of motor chunks, even when the sequences included only
               two elements, and showed that preparation (and in particular,
               selection) of a forthcoming sequence may occur during execution
               of the earlier sequence. Sequences including only two keys

               dedicated motor processor, and that the cognitive processor can
               be allocated to preparing a forthcoming sequence (e.g., during

               selection. But inconsistent empirical results challenge any
               mechanistic interpretation. A behavioral experiment first
               verified an apparent boundary condition in a blocked picture

              about the extent to which metacognitive processes are related to
              first-order task performance are mixed. The current study aimed to
              uncover the relationships among children's monitoring
              (discrimination between correct and incorrect responses), control
              (accurate withdrawal of wrong answers), and performance across
              three memory-based learning tasks: Kanji learning, text
              comprehension, and secret code learning. All tasks consisted of a
              study phase, a test phase, monitoring (confidence judgments), and
              control (maintaining/withdrawing responses). Participants were 325
              children (151 second graders [Mage = 8.12 years] and 174 fourth
              graders [Mage = 10.20 years]). Confirmatory factor analyses showed
              that a model in which monitoring and control loaded on a joint

               syntactic structures they recently encountered (structural
               priming). Individuals differ in the extent to which they are
               primed (primeability). Previous research has suggested that
               perspective-taking, that is, the ability to imagine the feelings,
               thoughts and perceptions of others, predicts the magnitude of
               priming in adults. The present study investigates if this also
               holds for monolingual and bilingual children. We primed the
               possessive structure in monolingual Dutch children and bilingual
               children with varying L2s. There was individual variation in
               children's primeability in both groups. For both monolinguals and
               bilinguals, we found that the better children were at
               perspective-taking, the more likely they were to be primed. Dutch
               language proficiency also influenced children's primeability:
               higher language proficiency resulted in more priming in both
               groups. The findings suggest that structural priming serves a

	abstract = {Response inhibition is a key attribute of human executive
               control. Standard stop-signal tasks require countermanding a
               single response; the speed at which that response can be
               inhibited indexes the efficacy of the inhibitory control
               networks. However, more complex stopping tasks, where one or more
               components of a multi-component action are cancelled (i.e.,
               response-selective stopping) cannot be explained by the
               independent-race model appropriate for the simple task (Logan and
               Cowan 1984). Healthy human participants (n=28; 10 male; 19--40
               years) completed a response-selective stopping task where a `go'
               stimulus required simultaneous (bimanual) button presses in
               response to left and right pointing green arrows. On a subset of
               trials (30\%) one, or both, arrows turned red (constituting the
               stop signal) requiring that only the button-press(es) associated
               with red arrows be cancelled. Electromyographic recordings from
               both index fingers (first dorsal interosseous) permitted the
               assessment of both voluntary motor responses that resulted in
               overt button presses, and activity that was cancelled prior to an
               overt response (i.e., partial, or covert, responses). We propose
               a simultaneously inhibit and start (SIS) model that extends the
               independent race model and provides a highly accurate account of
               response-selective stopping data. Together with fine-grained EMG
               analysis, our model-based analysis offers converging evidence
               that the selective-stop signal simultaneously triggers a process
               that stops the bimanual response and triggers a new unimanual
               response corresponding to the green arrow. Our results require a
               reconceptualisation of response-selective stopping and offer a
               tractable framework for assessing such tasks in healthy and
               patient populations. Significance Statement Response inhibition
               is a key attribute of human executive control, frequently
               investigated using the stop-signal task. After initiating a motor
               response to a go signal, a stop signal occasionally appears at a
               delay, requiring cancellation of the response. This has been
               conceptualised as a `race' between the go and stop processes,
               with the successful (or failed) cancellation determined by which
               process wins the race. Here we provide a novel computational
               model for a complex variation of the stop-signal task, where only
               one component of a multicomponent action needs to be cancelled.
               We provide compelling muscle activation data that support our
               model, providing a robust and plausible framework for studying
               these complex inhibition tasks in both healthy and pathological

               sewing machine, and delicate movements such as threading a needle
               in the same machine. Using a structure with different control
               architectures, the motor system is capable of updating its
               ability to perform through our daily interaction with the
               fluctuating environment. However, there are issues that make this
               a difficult computational problem for the brain to solve. The
               brain needs to control a nonlinear, nonstationary neuromuscular
               system, with redundant and occasionally undesired degrees of
               freedom, in an uncertain environment using a body in which
               information transmission is subject to delays and noise. To gain
               insight into the mechanisms of motor control, here we survey
               movement laws and invariances that shape our everyday motion. We
               then examine the major solutions to each of these problems in the
               three parts of the sensorimotor control system, sensing,
               planning, and acting. We focus on how the sensory system, the
               control architectures, and the structure and operation of the
               muscles serve as complementary mechanisms to overcome deviations
               and disturbances to motor behavior and give rise to skillful
               motor performance. We conclude with possible future research

              nondominant language, but when switching to the dominant language,
              the positivity started later, and was never larger than when
              switching to the nondominant language. In addition, switch effects
              on function words were not significantly larger than those on
              content words in any analyses. In Experiment 2, participants
              produced more cross-language intrusion errors when switching to
              the dominant than to the nondominant language, and more errors on
              function than content words. These results implicate different

	abstract = {Flow is a state of full task engagement that is accompanied with
               low-levels of self-referential thinking. Flow is considered
               highly relevant for human performance and well-being and has,
               therefore, been studied extensively. Yet, the neurocognitive
               processes of flow remain largely unclear. In the present
               mini-review we focus on how the brain's locus
               coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system may be involved in a
               range of behavioral and subjective manifestations of flow. The
               LC-NE system regulates decisions regarding task engagement vs.
               disengagement. This is done via different modes of baseline and
               stimulus-evoked norepinephrine release. We emphasize the
               theoretical and empirical overlap between the LC-NE system and
               flow. For both, a match between a person's skill and task
               challenge is important in order to induce high levels
               task-related attention. Moreover, psychophysiological indicators
               of LC-NE system activity, such as eye pupil diameter and arousal
               are also sensitive to flow states. Flow is related to arousal in
               an inverted U-shape. Similarly, in theories on the LC-NE system,
               task engagement is highest with intermediate levels of arousal.
               We argue that knowledge about the role of the LC-NE system in
               establishing the flow experience may help to gain fundamental
               knowledge of flow and can contribute to unifying various

               motor repertoire, but has ignored the role of object information.
               In this manuscript, we set out an alternative conception of
               intention understanding, which places the role of objects as
               central to our observation and comprehension of the actions of

              hand, a deactivation and concomitant decrease in monitoring and
              focused attention has been suggested to facilitate spontaneous
              associations and novel insights. Here, we demonstrate that
              prefrontal engagement in creative cognition depends dramatically
              on experimental conditions, that is, the goal of the task. We
              instructed professional pianists to perform improvisations on a
              piano keyboard during fMRI and play, either with a certain
              emotional content (happy/fearful), or using certain keys
              (tonal/atonal pitch-sets). We found lower activity in primarily
              the right DLPFC, dorsal premotor cortex and inferior parietal
              cortex during emotional conditions compared with pitch-set
              conditions. Furthermore, the DLPFC was functionally connected to
              the default mode network during emotional conditions and to the
              premotor network during pitch-set conditions. The results thus
              support the notion of two broad cognitive strategies for creative
              problem solving, relying on extrospective and introspective neural
              circuits, respectively.},

               of long-term practice, but no studies have investigated the
               specific effects of training musical creativity. Here, we used
               human functional MRI to measure brain activity during
               improvisation in a sample of 39 professional pianists with
               varying backgrounds in classical and jazz piano playing. We found
               total hours of improvisation experience to be negatively
               associated with activity in frontoparietal executive cortical
               areas. In contrast, improvisation training was positively
               associated with functional connectivity of the bilateral
               dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, dorsal premotor cortices, and
               presupplementary areas. The effects were significant when

               improvisation (compared to production of over-learned musical
               sequences) was consistently characterized by a dissociated
               pattern of activity in the prefrontal cortex: extensive

               regions with focal activation of the medial prefrontal (frontal

               stimuli for participants to retain during a short interval and
               then retrieve. Stimuli were either randomly arranged or
               structured (forming symmetries and regular shapes for the spatial
               task and mathematical patterns for the verbal task). Although
               participants performed the structured tasks better by
               reorganizing or ``chunking'' them into more efficient forms, LPFC

               fitness. Moreover, studying expertise in nonhumans can help us
               understand human expertise. Several features that distinguish
               experts within their domain of expertise from novices include (1)
               greater long-term memory, (2) larger capacity of working memory,
               (3) better ability to focus attention on the most relevant

               and comprehend the relevant elements in one's surroundings, (5)
               quicker and better decisions, and (6) faster and more coordinated
               motor movements. The development of expertise follows a
               characteristic pattern of gradual improvement in performance over
               extended periods devoted to practising a given complex task.
               Heritable variation in a few traits can affect the rate of

               sports and games 1996), and deliberate practice appears to be
               outside of the bounds of unconscious processing, then any signs
               of expertise development in an animal are indicators of
               consciousness. Rossano's argument may lead to an unsolvable
               debate about animal consciousness while causing researchers to
               overlook the underlying reality of animal expertise. This article
               provides evidence indicative of animals meeting each of the three
               definitions of expertise established in the scientific
               literature: expertise as a social construction, expertise as
               exceptional performance, and expertise as knowledge. In addition,
               cases of deliberate practice by non-human animals are offered.
               Acknowledging some animals as experts, regardless of
               consciousness, is warranted by the research findings and would
               prove useful in solving many issues remaining in the human

               Spanish--English bilinguals in the U.S. read single-language and

               tasks is usually impaired compared with separate single-task
               performance. Numerous theories explain these emerging dual-task
               costs in terms of the existence of capacity limitations in the
               constituent component tasks. The current paper proposes active
               dual-task coordination processes that work on the scheduling of
               these capacity-limited processes. Further, there are recent
               findings that point to a meta-cognitive control level in addition

               skill. In modern humans, complex motor skills and craft skills,

	abstract = {Many complex actions are mentally pre-composed as plans that
               specify orderings of simpler actions. To be executed accurately,
               planned orderings must become active in working memory, and then
               enacted one-by-one until the sequence is complete. Examples
               include writing, typing, and speaking. In cases where the planned
               complex action is musical in nature (e.g. a choreographed dance
               or a piano melody), it appears to be possible to deploy two
               learned sequences at the same time, one composed from actions and
               a second composed from the time intervals between actions.
               Despite this added complexity, humans readily learn and perform
               rhythm-based action sequences. Notably, people can learn action
               sequences and rhythmic sequences separately, and then combine
               them with little trouble (Ull{\'e}n \& Bengtsson 2003). Related
               functional MRI data suggest that there are distinct neural
               regions responsible for the two different sequence types
               (Bengtsson et al. 2004). Although research on musical rhythm is
               extensive, few computational models exist to extend and inform
               our understanding of its neural bases. To that end, this article
               introduces the TAMSIN (Timing And Motor System Integration
               Network) model, a systems-level neural network model capable of
               performing arbitrary item sequences in accord with any rhythmic
               pattern that can be represented as a sequence of integer
               multiples of a base interval. In TAMSIN, two Competitive Queuing
               (CQ) modules operate in parallel. One represents and controls
               item order (the ORD module) and the second represents and
               controls the sequence of inter-onset-intervals (IOIs) that define
               a rhythmic pattern (RHY module). Further circuitry helps these

              insights from cognitive psychology, neuroscience, archaeology and
              behavioural ecology, we hypothesize that this singular occurrence
              was triggered by exaptation, or 'hijacking', of existing cognitive
              mechanisms related to sequential processing and motor execution.
              Observed coupling of the communication system with circuits
              related to complex action planning and control supports this
              proposition, but the prehistoric ecological contexts in which this
              coupling may have occurred and its adaptive value remain elusive.
              Evolutionary reasoning rules out most existing hypotheses
              regarding the ecological context of language evolution, which
              focus on ultimate explanations and ignore proximate mechanisms.
              Coupling of communication and motor systems, although possible in
              a short period on evolutionary timescales, required a
              multi-stepped adaptive process, involving multiple genes and gene
              networks. We suggest that the behavioural context that exerted the
              selective pressure to drive these sequential adaptations had to be
              one in which each of the systems undergoing coupling was
              independently necessary or highly beneficial, as well as frequent
              and recurring over evolutionary time. One such context could have
              been the teaching of tool production or tool use. In the present
              study, we propose the Cognitive Coupling hypothesis, which brings

               alone underperform in stone tool-making experiments in comparison
               to subjects instructed through either gesture alone or 'full
               language' (gesture plus speech), and also report lower
               satisfaction with their received instruction. The results provide
               evidence that gesture was likely to be selected over speech as a
               teaching aid in the earliest hominin tool-makers; that speech
               could not have replaced gesturing as a tool-making teaching aid
               in later hominins, possibly explaining the functional retention
               of gesturing in the full language of modern humans; and that
               speech may have evolved for reasons unrelated to tool-making. We
               conclude that speech is unlikely to have evolved as tool-making
               teaching aid superior to gesture, as claimed by the technological
               hypothesis, and therefore alternative views should be considered.
               For example, gestural language may have evolved to enable
               tool-making in earlier hominins, while speech may have later
               emerged as a response to increased trade and more complex inter-
               and intra-group interactions in Middle Pleistocene ancestors of
               Neanderthals and Homo sapiens; or gesture and speech may have
               evolved in parallel rather than in sequence.},

               transmission was studied through the outer and middle ears in
               five individuals from the Sima de los Huesos, four chimpanzees
               and four modern humans. The results were then used to calculate
               the occupied bandwidth of the outer and middle ears, an important
               variable related with communicative capacities. The results
               demonstrate that the Atapuerca SH hominins were similar to modern
               humans in this aspect, falling within the lower half of the range
               of variation, and clearly distinct from chimpanzees.
               Specifically, the Atapuerca SH hominins show a bandwidth that is
               slightly displaced and considerably extended to encompass the
               frequencies that contain relevant acoustic information in human
               speech, permitting the transmission of a larger amount of
               information with fewer errors. At the same time, the presence of
               a complete cervical segment of the spinal column associated with
               Cranium 5 from the Sima de los Huesos Middle Pleistocene site

               The results demonstrate that it is similar to the reconstructed
               vocal tract in the La Ferrassie 1 Neandertal individual, which

               range of sounds emitted during modern human spoken language.

               making is attained only by highly skilled individuals who have

               such as speech errors, decision about syntactic form, and
               reaction time performance. Next, the author describes an approach
               to syntax from the field of computational linguistics known as
               tree-adjoining grammars (TAGs), associated with A. Joshi and
               colleagues. The important fundamental feature of this approach is
               that is assumes the existence of primitive, basic syntactic
               trees, which are combined in various constrained ways. This
               description of TAG will highlight the characteristics of

               the properties of the approach that are especially relevant to
               researchers interested in syntactic production. The author then
               reviews some of the literature on syntactic production, focusing
               on (a) lexical influences on syntactic form, (b) syntactic
               priming, (c) computation of agreement (e.g., subject--verb), and

               meaning-equivalent surface structures available (e.g., for dative
               verbs, ``gave the letter to her mother,'' ``gave her mother the
               letter''). In three experiments we tested the hypothesis that this
               verbatim bias is the result of syntactic priming (Bock, 1986). In
               Experiment 1 single sentences were recalled; the prime sentence
               preceded the target dative sentence. In Experiments 2 and 3
               two-clause sentences were recalled; the second clause served as a
               prime that had been perceived but not yet recalled when the first
               clause was produced, or vice versa. When the prime sentence or
               clause was a dative that mismatched the surface structure of the
               target there was an increase in changes to the alternate (primed)
               structure in recall of the target, compared with control primes.
               These results support the hypothesis that simply perceiving a
               sentence is enough to prime its surface syntactic structure,
               contributing to verbatim recall.},

               that thematic roles help to mediate the mapping from messages to
               syntax. However, research using structural priming has suggested
               that the construction of syntactic frames may be insensitive to
               variations in thematic roles within messages (Cognition 35 (1990)
               1; Psychological Review 99 (1992) 150). Because these studies
               involved structural alternations whose syntax covaries with the
               order of thematic roles, it is difficult to assess any
               independent contribution that role information may make to the
               positioning of phrases. In this study, we primed the order of the
               roles without changing the syntactic structure of the sentences
               produced, and found that the order of the roles was influenced by
               the priming manipulation. This implies that thematic roles or the

               dependency. What is the nature of the cognitive process that
               allows speakers to produce sentences that include distant
               elements that form dependencies? In four experiments, speakers
               described drawings that elicited long-distance dependencies.
               Critically, speakers were sometimes primed to produce a that in
               sentences where that was ungrammatical due to a grammatical
               constraint known as the that-trace constraint (e.g.,*Who does the

               argument is an agent (e.g., jump). 1 Past psycholinguistic
               experiments suggest that this distinction affects how sentences
               are processed: for example, it modulates both comprehension
               processes ( Bever and Sanz 1997 , Friedmann et al. 2008 ) and
               production processes ( Kegl 1995 , Kim 2006 , M. Lee and Thompson
               2004 , J. Lee and Thompson 2011 , McAllister et al. 2009 ). Given
               this body of evidence, it is reasonable to assume, as we do here,
               that this distinction is directly relevant to psycholinguistic
               theorizing. However, especially in production, exactly how this
               distinction affects processing is unknown, beyond the suggestion
               that unaccusatives somehow involve more complex processing than
               unergatives (see J. Lee and Thompson 2011 ). Here we examine how
               real-time planning processes in production differ for
               unaccusatives and unergatives. We build on previous studies on

               the central role of verbs in structural encoding, and thus
               predict that verbs should be selected early in sentence
               formulation, possibly even before the phonological encoding of
               the first constituent (Ferreira, 2000). However, the most direct
               experimental test of this hypothesis (Schriefers, Teruel, \&
               Meinshausen, 1998) found no evidence for advance verb selection
               in verb-final (subject-verb and subject-object-verb) utterances

               interference task (Meyer, 1996; Schriefers et al., 1998),
               demonstrates that in Japanese, a strongly verb-final language,
               verbs are indeed planned in advance, but selectively before
               object noun articulation and not before subject noun
               articulation. This contrasting pattern of advance verb selection

               decide which entity to assign to which grammatical function.
               According to the lexical hypothesis (e.g., Bock \& Levelt, 1994),
               verbs play a key role in this process (e.g., ``send'' and
               ``receive'' result in different entities being assigned to the
               subject position). In contrast, according to the structural
               hypothesis (e.g., Bock, Irwin, \& Davidson, 2004), grammatical
               functions can be assigned based on a speaker's conceptual
               representation of an event, even before a particular verb is
               chosen. In order to examine the role of the verb in grammatical
               function assignment, we investigated whether English and Korean
               speakers exhibit semantic interference effects for verbs during a
               scene description task. We also analyzed speakers' eye movements
               during production. We found that English speakers exhibited verb
               interference effects and also fixated the action/verb region
               before the subject region. In contrast, Korean speakers did not
               show any verb interference effects and did not fixate the
               action/verb region before the subject region. Rather, in Korean,
               looks to the action/verb region sharply increased following looks
               to the object region. The findings provide evidence for the
               lexical hypothesis for English and are compatible with the
               structural hypothesis for Korean. We suggest that whether the
               verb is retrieved before speech onset depends on the role that
               the verb plays in grammatical function assignment or structural

               in addition to the pronunciation of the word in isolation, a
               context-specific pronunciation variant that appears only when the

               flapping in a procedure with a response delay relative to a
               speeded response, and an attenuation of the following word
               frequency effect with delayed responses. This reveals that within
               speakers, the degree of advance planning varies continuously from

               complexity (as measured by the number of nodes in a phrase
               structure tree) affected the time it took subjects to initiate

               question of whether the scope of grammatical advance planning in
               sentence production corresponds to some fixed unit or rather is
               flexible. Subjects produced sentences of different formats under
               varying amounts of cognitive load. When speakers described
               2-object displays with simple sentences of the form ``the frog is
               next to the mug,'' the 2 nouns were found to be
               lexically-semantically activated to similar degrees at speech
               onset, as indexed by similarly sized interference effects from
               semantic distractors related to either the first or the second
               noun. When speakers used more complex sentences (including
               prenominal color adjectives; e.g., ``the blue frog is next to the
               blue mug'') much larger interference effects were observed for
               the first than the second noun, suggesting that the second noun
               was lexically-semantically activated before speech onset on only
               a subset of trials. With increased cognitive load, introduced by
               an additional conceptual decision task and variable utterance
               formats, the interference effect for the first noun was increased
               and the interference effect for second noun disappeared,
               suggesting that the scope of advance planning had been narrowed.
               By contrast, if cognitive load was induced by a secondary working
               memory task to be performed during speech planning, the
               interference effect for both nouns was increased, suggesting that
               the scope of advance planning had not been affected. In all, the
               data suggest that the scope of advance planning during
               grammatical encoding in sentence production is flexible, rather

	abstract = {AbstractPrevious work has shown that English native speakers
               interpret sentences as predicted by a noisy‐channel model: They
               integrate both the real‐world plausibility of the meaning---the
               prior---and the likelihood that the intended sentence may be
               corrupted into the perceived sentence. In this study, we test the
               noisy‐channel model in Mandarin Chinese, a language taxonomically
               different from English. We present native Mandarin speakers
               sentences in a written modality (Experiment 1) and an auditory
               modality (Experiment 2) in three pairs of syntactic alternations.
               The critical materials are literally implausible but require
               differing numbers and types of edits in order to form more
               plausible sentences. Each sentence is followed by a comprehension
               question that allows us to infer whether the speakers interpreted
               the item literally, or made an inference toward a more likely
               meaning. Similar to previous research on related English
               constructions, Mandarin participants made the most inferences for
               implausible materials that could be inferred as plausible by
               deleting a single morpheme or inserting a single morpheme.
               Participants were less likely to infer a plausible meaning for
               materials that could be inferred as plausible by making an
               exchange across a preposition. And participants were least likely
               to infer a plausible meaning for materials that could be inferred
               as plausible by making an exchange across a main verb. Moreover,
               we found more inferences in written materials than spoken
               materials, possibly a result of a lack of word boundaries in
               written Chinese. Overall, the fact that the results were so
               similar to those found in related constructions in English
               suggests that the noisy‐channel proposal is robust.},

               ``immediately''. However, even basic aspects of the time-line of
               word recognition are still controversial. Different domains of
               research have still not converged on a coherent account. An
               integration of multiple sources of information would lead to more
               strongly constrained theoretical models, and help finding optimal
               measures when monitoring specific aspects of word recognition
               impairments in patient groups. In our multimodal
               approach--combining fast behavioral measures, ERPs and EEG/MEG
               source estimation--we provide converging evidence for the
               latencies of earliest lexical and semantic information retrieval
               in visual word recognition. Participants performed lexical and
               semantic decisions (LD, SD) in a Go/NoGo paradigm. We introduced
               eye-blink latencies as a dependent variable, in order to measure
               behavioral responses that are faster and less variable than
               traditional button presses. We found that the earliest behavioral
               responses distinguishing stimulus categories can occur around 310
               ms. Ex-Gaussian analysis of behavioral responses did not reveal
               reliable differences between LD and SD. The earliest ERP
               differences between Go and NoGo conditions occurred around 160 ms
               for both LD and SD. Distributed source analysis of combined
               EEG/MEG data estimated neuronal generators for the lexicality
               effect around 200 ms in the left anterior middle temporal lobe.
               Thus, behavior and brain responses provide coherent evidence that
               the brain starts retrieving lexical and semantic information
               near-simultaneously within 200 ms of word onset. Our results
               support models of word recognition that assume a continuous
               accumulation of task-related information from the stimulus, which
               might be described by Bayesian principles.},

               key for understanding the relationship between bilingual language
               control and cognitive control. The current study used multi-voxel
               pattern analysis (MVPA) to examine within-subject patterns of

               during bilingual language switching and non-linguistic

               identifiable, within-subject patterns of DLPFC activity for both
               types of switching and that bilinguals and monolinguals would
               differ in patterns of DLPFC activity for task-switching. We were
               unable to identify patterns of DLPFC activity associated with
               bilingual language switching. Task-switching was related to
               patterns of left DLPFC activity for both bilinguals and
               monolinguals, and there were identifiable patterns of right DLPFC
               activity for the bilinguals only. These findings suggest that the

               for every psycholinguist, there has become an increasing need to
               understand them more fully. In the last decade, most work on
               mixed-effects models in psycholinguistics has focused on properly
               specifying the random-effects structure to minimize error in
               evaluating the statistical significance of fixed-effects
               predictors. The present study examines a potential
               misspecification of random effects that has not been discussed in
               psycholinguistics: violation of the single-subject-population
               assumption, in the context of logistic regression. Estimated
               random-effects distributions in real studies often appear to be
               bi- or multimodal. However, there is no established way to
               estimate whether a random-effects distribution corresponds to
               more than one underlying population, especially in the more
               common case of a multivariate distribution of random effects. We
               show that violations of the single-subject-population assumption
               can usually be detected by assessing the (multivariate) normality
               of the inferred random-effects structure, unless the data show
               quasi-separability, i.e., many subjects or items show
               near-categorical behavior. In the absence of quasi-separability,
               several clustering methods are successful in determining which
               group each participant belongs to. The BIC difference between a

               through the manipulation of foreperiods, the role of force level
               during temporal preparation remains underexplored. In our study,
               we propose to manipulate mental training of attentional control
               in order to shed light on the role of the force level and
               autonomic nervous system in the temporal preparation of an
               action. Forty subjects, divided into mental training group (n =
               20) and without mental training group (n = 20), participated in
               this study. The influence of the attentional control and force
               levels on the autonomic nervous system were measured using the
               skin conductance response and the heart rate variability; the
               accuracy of the motor responses was measured using a method
               derived from machine learning. Behaviorally, only the mental
               training group reinforced its motor and attentional control. When
               using short foreperiod durations and high force level, motor and
               attentional control decreased, consistent with the dominant
               sympathetic system. This resulted in an increased anticipation
               rate of responses with a higher reaction time compared to the
               long foreperiods duration and low force level, in which the
               reaction time significantly decreased, with enhancement of the
               expected force level, showing consistency with the dominant
               parasympathetic system. Interestingly, results revealed a
               predictive relationship between the sympathovagal balance and
               motor and attentional control during the long foreperiods and low
               force level. Finally, results demonstrate that attentional mental
               training leads to the reinforcement of interactions between the
               autonomic nervous system and attentional processes which are
               involved in the temporal preparation of a force task.},

	abstract = {AbstractDevelopmental science has experienced a vivid debate on
               whether young children prioritize goals over means in their
               prediction of others' actions. Influential developmental theories
               highlight the role of goal objects for action understanding. Yet,
               recent infant studies report evidence for the opposite. The
               empirical evidence is therefore inconclusive. The current study
               advanced this debate by assessing preschool children's verbal
               predictions of others' actions. In five experiments (N = 302), we
               investigated whether preschool children and adults predict agents
               to move towards their previous goal (that is, show goal‐related
               predictions) or predict agents to move along the same movement
               path that they pursued before. While Experiments 1a, 1b and 1c
               presented young children and adults with animated agents,
               Experiments 2a and 2b presented participants with human grasping
               action. An integrative analysis across experiments revealed that
               children were more likely to predict the agent to move along the
               same movement path, Z = ‐4.574, p ≤ 0.0001 (r = 0.304). That is,
               preschool children were more likely to predict that agents would
               move along the same trajectory even though this action would lead
               to a new goal object. Thus, our findings suggest that young
               children's action prediction relies on the detection of spatial
               and movement information. Overall, we discuss our findings in
               terms of theoretical frameworks that conceive of action
               understanding as an umbrella term that comprises different forms
               and facets in which humans understand others' actions.Highlights
               We investigated whether preschool children predict agents to move
               towards their previous goal or to move along the same movement
               path that they pursued before. Unlike adults, preschool children
               predicted that agents would move along the same trajectory even
               though this action would lead to a new goal. Adults' goal‐based
               predictions were affected from contextual details, whereas
               children systematically made path‐based predictions. Young

               invasiveness, performance, spatial coverage and spatiotemporal
               resolution. Functional ultrasound (fUS) neuroimaging is an
               emerging technology that balances these attributes and may
               complement existing BMI recording technologies. In this study, we
               use fUS to demonstrate a successful implementation of a

	abstract = {AbstractOver the past several decades, research in the cognitive
               sciences has foregrounded the importance of active bodies and
               their continuous dependence on the changing environment,
               strengthening the relevance of dynamical models. These models
               have been steadily developed within the ecological psychology
               approach to cognition, which arguably contributes to the
               ``ecological turn'' we are witnessing today. The embodied and
               situated nature of cognition, regarded by some as a passing
               trend, is presently becoming a largely accepted assumption. In
               this paper, I claim that in light of these developments,
               ecological psychology, in alliance with related approaches, such
               as enactivism and interactivism, has the potential to deeply
               transform our perspectives on cognition and action, restoring
               their pertinence to humans as persons. However, an important
               challenge to the realization of this potential has to be noted:
               neither the mainstream information‐processing approach nor the
               dynamics‐oriented perspective on cognition provides an account of
               how the capacity of humans to use language and think
               ``symbolically'' can be derived from the continuous flow of
               agent−environment interaction. I will attempt to show that posing
               the ``dynamical'' and ``computational'' hypotheses about the nature
               of cognition as mutually exclusive approaches to cognition
               results in undesirable reductionism, which makes it difficult to
               meet this challenge. There are good reasons, advanced over half a
               century ago by, for example, Michael Polanyi or Howard Pattee, to
               think that we need complementary descriptions to understand
               cognizing systems, in order to grasp the fact that they are
               governed both by physical laws and by emergent historical
               constraints. Details of such a complementarity‐based approach
               still await elucidation, but some proposed solutions have the
               potential to ease the tension between the information‐processing
               and dynamical approaches to cognition and to lead to a better
               understanding of their interrelation.},

               question in cognitive psychology. Here we focused on
               understanding the representations and processes that underlie
               structural priming, the speaker's tendency to repeat sentence
               structures encountered earlier. Verb repetition from the prime to
               the target led to a stronger tendency to produce locative
               variants of the spray-load alternation following locative primes
               (e.g., load the boxes into the van) than following with primes
               (e.g., load the van with the boxes). These structural variants
               had the same constituent structure, ruling out abstract syntactic
               structure as the source of the verb boost effect. Furthermore,
               using cleft constructions (e.g., What the assistant loaded into
               the lift was the equipment), we found that the thematic role
               order (thematic role-position mappings) of the prime can persist
               separately from its argument structure (thematic role-syntactic
               function mappings). Moreover, both priming effects were enhanced
               by verb repetition and interacted with each other when the
               construction of the prime was also repeated in the target. These
               findings are incompatible with the traditional staged model of
               grammatical encoding, which postulates the independence of
               abstract syntax from thematic role information. We propose the
               interactive structure-building account, according to which
               speakers build a sentence structure by choosing a thematic role
               order and argument structure interactively based on their prior
               co-occurrence together with other structurally relevant

               components: representations, operations, structures and encoding.
               Recent intracranial research has begun to map out the feature
               space associated with syntactic processes, but the field lacks a
               unified framework that can direct invasive neural analyses. This
               article proposes a neurocomputational architecture for syntax,
               termed ROSE (Representation, Operation, Structure, Encoding).
               Under ROSE, the basic data structures of syntax are atomic
               features, types of mental representations (R), and are coded at
               the single-unit and ensemble level. Operations (O) transforming
               these units into manipulable objects accessible to subsequent
               structure-building levels are coded via high frequency broadband
               γ activity. Low frequency synchronization and cross-frequency
               coupling code for recursive structural inferences (S). Distinct
               forms of low frequency coupling encode these structures onto
               distinct workspaces (E). Causally connecting R to O is
               spike-phase/LFP coupling; connecting O to S is phase-amplitude
               coupling; connecting S to E are frontotemporal traveling
               oscillations. ROSE is reliant on neurophysiologically plausible

               modern human practices spanning science, industry, and politics.
               Although some early numeral systems used 1-to-1 correspondence
               (e.g., `IIII' to represent 4), most systems provide compact
               representations via more arbitrary conventions (e.g., `7' and
               `VII'). When people are unable to rely on conventional numerals,
               however, what strategies do they initially use to communicate
               number? Across three experiments, participants used pictures to
               communicate about visual arrays of objects containing 1--16 items,
               either by producing freehand drawings or combining sets of visual
               tokens. We analyzed how the pictures they produced varied as a
               function of communicative need (Experiment 1), spatial
               regularities in the arrays (Experiment 2), and visual properties
               of tokens (Experiment 3). In Experiment 1, we found that
               participants often expressed number in the form of 1-to-1
               representations, but sometimes also exploited the configuration
               of sets. In Experiment 2, this strategy of using configural cues
               was exaggerated when sets were especially large, and when the
               cues were predictably correlated with number. Finally, in
               Experiment 3, participants readily adopted salient numerical
               features of objects (e.g., four-leaf clover) and generally
               combined them in a cumulative-additive manner. Taken together,
               these findings corroborate historical evidence that humans
               exploit correlates of number in the external environment -- such
               as shape, configural cues, or 1-to-1 correspondence -- as the

               task to use images and videos to guide people to observe, match
               and reinforce the memory of sequence. Seven subjects' ERPs and MI
               performance are analyzed under four different levels of
               complexities or orders of the sequence. Results demonstrated that
               the action sequence in terms of complexity and sequence order
               significantly affects the MI. The complex action in positive
               order obtains stronger ERD/ERS and more pronounced MI feature
               distributions, and yields an MI classification accuracy that is
               12.3\% higher than complex action in negative order (p < 0.05).
               In addition, the ERP amplitudes derived from the supplementary
               motor area show a positive correlation to the MI. This study
               demonstrates a new perspective of improving imagery in the MI-BCI
               by considering the complexity and order of the action sequences,
               and provides a novel index for manifesting the MI performance by
               ERP.},

	abstract = {Driving a car requires a complex combination of various cognitive
               functions (e.g., visual perception, motor control, decision
               making, and others), and deficits in any of these processes may
               compromise driving safety. Amongst these, executive functions
               such as inhibitory control, task switching, and decision-making
               are important, as they enable drivers to process information from
               their surroundings and respond appropriately to changing road
               conditions. Although previous research has focused on laboratory
               measures of individual executive functions, it remains unclear
               whether performance on such laboratory tests readily translates
               to actual on-the-road driving performance, especially since
               drivers' skill levels can vary widely, based on their driving
               frequency. To this end, we divided 30 participants into two
               categories based on their driving frequency (i.e., daily commuter
               vs. weekend only drivers), and we used three well-known executive
               functioning tasks (the stop signal task, Iowa gambling task or
               IGT, and a task-switching test) to see whether scores on these
               tasks predicted such driving performances and behaviors such as
               braking time, lane-keeping, speed limit violations, and
               inter-vehicle distance (e.g., in a driving simulator).
               Participants went through a follow-lead-car scenario in the
               driving simulator for 20 minutes and then completed the three
               executive tasks. We found that stop signal reaction time (SSRT)
               best predicted driving performance, and remained predictive
               against driver distraction, as well as variabilities in driving
               frequency. The IGT predicted speed limit violations in
               high-frequency drivers, whereas task-switching cost predicted
               lane keeping performance in low-frequency drivers. Together,
               these results highlight the importance of driving frequency when
               considering correlates between executive functions and driving
               performance and behavior. They also imply that executive tasks
               better predict driving performance in low-frequency (or
               inexperienced) drivers, while driver temperament (i.e.,
               impulsiveness as indicated by IGT) better predicted driving
               performance in high-frequency (or experienced) drivers.},

	abstract = {AbstractGreat storytelling takes us on a journey the way ordinary
               reality rarely does. But what exactly do we mean by this
               ``journey?'' Recently, literary theorist Karin Kukkonen proposed
               that storytelling is ``probability design:'' the art of giving an
               audience pieces of information bit by bit, to craft the journey
               of their changing beliefs about the fictional world. A good
               ``probability design'' choreographs a delicate dance of certainty
               and surprise in the reader's mind as the story unfolds from
               beginning to end. In this paper, we computationally model this
               conception of storytelling. Building on the classic Bayesian
               inverse planning model of human social cognition, we treat
               storytelling as inverse inverse planning: the task of choosing
               actions to manipulate an inverse planner's inferences, and
               therefore a human audience's beliefs. First, we use an inverse
               inverse planner to depict social and physical situations, and
               present behavioral studies indicating that inverse inverse
               planning produces more expressive behavior than ordinary ``na{\"\i}ve
               planning.'' Then, through a series of examples, we demonstrate how
               inverse inverse planning captures many storytelling elements from
               first principles: character, narrative arcs, plot twists, irony,
               flashbacks, and deus ex machina are all naturally encoded in the
               flexible language of probability design.},

               motor control are less understood, with some studies showing
               deficits and others indicating normal performance. Eighteen users
               and 23 nonusers performed a motor sequencing task during
               high‐density magnetoencephalography (MEG). The MEG data was
               transformed into the time‐frequency domain and beta responses
               (16--24 Hz) during motor planning and execution phases were imaged
               separately using a beamformer approach. Whole‐brain maps were
               examined for group (cannabis user/nonuser) and time window
               (planning/execution) effects. As expected, there were no group
               differences in task performance (e.g., reaction time, accuracy,
               etc.). Regular cannabis users exhibited stronger beta
               oscillations in the contralateral primary motor cortex compared
               to nonusers during the execution phase of the motor sequences,
               but not during the motor planning phase. Similar group‐by‐time
               window interactions were observed in the left superior parietal,
               right inferior frontal cortices, right posterior insular cortex,
               and the bilateral motor cortex. We observed differences in the
               neural dynamics serving motor control in regular cannabis users

               compensatory processing in both primary motor and higher‐order

               shared agency, social rules, and rule‐guided organized
               institutions. A function of our capacity for planning agency is
               the support of these forms of practical organization. I highlight

               automatic processes regulate health behavior. Further research is
               required to test the basic postulates of dual-process theories.
               We investigated the direct associations and moderating effect
               between automatic processes and multiple indicators of reflective
               processes on various levels of physical activity and sedentary
               behavior assessed using accelerometry in adults who were not
               participating in regular physical exercise programs. This
               cross-sectional study included 257 adults. Each participant
               completed a computerized test for automatic associations, a set
               of questions assessing reflective processes, a seven-day
               assessment using accelerometers to determine their levels of
               physical activity and sedentary behavior. The results showed a
               direct relationship between perceived benefits (B = 15.90, p =
               0.043), perceived cons (B = −12.81, p = 0.034), decisional
               intention (B = −0.07, p = 0.049) with light physical activity,
               and self-efficacy with daily steps (B = 485.71, p = 0.008). There
               was a positive association between intention strength and daily
               steps when implicit associations favored physical activity (b =
               623.36, LLCI = 79.09, ULCI = 1167.62, p = 0.025); a negative
               association between self-efficacy and sedentary behavior when
               implicit associations favored sedentary behavior (b = −25.73,
               LLCI = −49.77, ULCI = −1.70, p = 0.035); and a positive
               association between intention strength and sedentary behavior
               when implicit associations favored physical activity (b = 34.18,
               LLCI = 8.81, ULCI = 59.56, p = 0.008). These findings underscore
               the importance of considering the interplay between reflective

	abstract = {AbstractCommunicating with a speaker with a different accent can
               affect one's own speech. Despite the strength of evidence for
               perception-production transfer in speech, the nature of transfer
               has remained elusive, with variable results regarding the
               acoustic properties that transfer between speakers and the
               characteristics of the speakers who exhibit transfer. The current
               study investigates perception-production transfer through the
               lens of statistical learning across passive exposure to speech.
               Participants experienced a short sequence of acoustically
               variable minimal pair (beer/pier) utterances conveying either an
               accent or typical American English acoustics, categorized a
               perceptually ambiguous test stimulus, and then repeated the test
               stimulus aloud. In the canonical condition, /b/--/p/ fundamental
               frequency (F0) and voice onset time (VOT) covaried according to
               typical English patterns. In the reverse condition, the F0xVOT
               relationship reversed to create an ``accent'' with speech input
               regularities atypical of American English. Replicating prior
               studies, F0 played less of a role in perceptual speech
               categorization in reverse compared with canonical statistical
               contexts. Critically, this down-weighting transferred to
               production, with systematic down-weighting of F0 in listeners'
               own speech productions in reverse compared with canonical
               contexts that was robust across male and female participants.
               Thus, the mapping of acoustics to speech categories is rapidly
               adjusted by short-term statistical learning across passive
               listening and these adjustments transfer to influence listeners'
               own speech productions.},

	abstract = {Abstract Chunking is an effective mechanism to process sensory
              sequences. It remains unclear, however, whether the chunking
              mechanism is domain-general or specific to each input sensory
              modality. Here, we investigate the functions of the Broca's area
              and its right homolog mediating chunking when human participants
              break up auditory and visual sequences into chunks based on rules.
              Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we demonstrate that neural
              activity can track the rhythms of sensory chunks across the brain
              areas. Critically, the precision of chunk-tracking activity in the
              left and right inferior frontal gyri (IFG) separately predicts the
              behavioral performance for auditory and visual chunking.
              Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) further reveals that
              deactivating the left and right IFG distinctively influences the
              behavioral performance of auditory and visual chunking.
              Additionally, structural imaging shows that the strength of the
              left and right arcuate fasciculi, connecting frontal and temporal
              cortices, predicts both ipsilateral IFG activation and
              modality-dependent chunking performance. The consistent
              electrophysiological, neural modulation and structural
              connectivity results collectively suggest distinct hemispherical
              lateralized temporal-frontal networks for rule-based chunking in

               that an individual's sensitivity to detect the statistical
               regularities present in language (i.e., ``chunk sensitivity'') may
               significantly modulate online sentence processing. We

               habits). To test this hypothesis directly, we inactivated the
               sensorimotor territory of the globus pallidus internus (sGPi, the

               briefly to enter conscious awareness are nevertheless processed
               to some extent. Implicit learning, implicit memory, and
               conditioning studies suggest that the extent to which memory
               traces are available for verbal report and for cognitive control
               is likewise dependent on the time available for processing during
               acquisition. Differences in the time available for processing
               also determine not only the extent to which one becomes conscious
               of action, but also provides the basis for making attributions of
               authorship to experienced acts. In this paper, we offer a brief
               overview of these different findings and suggest that they can
               all be understood based on the fact that consciousness takes
               time. From this perspective, the availability of representations

               representations - the extent to which they are strong, stable in
               time, and distinctive. High-quality representations occur when
               processes of global competition have had sufficient time to
               operate so as to make the system settle into the best possible

               processing, through which representations can be further enriched

               cognitive architecture that is implementable in neuronal nets,

               activation-passing and highly distributed ``codelets,''

	abstract = {A large number of criteria have been proposed for determining
               when a behavior has become automatic. Almost all of these were
               developed before the widespread acceptance of multiple memory
               systems. Consequently, popular frameworks for studying
               automaticity often neglect qualitative differences in how
               different memory systems guide initial learning. Unfortunately,
               evidence suggests that automaticity criteria derived from these
               frameworks consistently misclassify certain sets of initial
               behaviors as automatic. Specifically, criteria derived from
               cognitive science mislabel much behavior still under the control
               of procedural memory as automatic, and criteria derived from
               animal learning mislabel some behaviors under the control of
               declarative memory as automatic. Even so, neither set of criteria
               make the opposite error-that is, both sets correctly identify any
               automatic behavior as automatic. In fact, evidence suggests that
               although there are multiple memory systems and therefore multiple
               routes to automaticity, there might nevertheless be only one
               common representation for automatic behaviors. A number of

               Participants were asked to build 2 different Lego walls. The
               walls were designed to have hierarchical structures with shared
               and dissociated colors and spatial components. Participants built

               Selection times for correctly completed trials were measured
               using 3-dimensional motion tracking. The paradigm enabled precise
               measurement of the timing of actions, while using real objects to
               create an end product. The experiment demonstrated that action
               selection was slowed at decision boundary points, relative to

               functions, including language, music, and action processing,
               several attempts have been made to propose a unifying theory of
               its role that emphasizes a possible contribution to syntactic
               processing. Recently, we have postulated that Broca's area might
               be involved in higher-order chunk processing during implicit
               learning of a motor sequence. Chunking is an
               information-processing mechanism that consists of grouping
               consecutive items in a sequence and is likely to be involved in
               all of the aforementioned cognitive processes. Demonstrating a
               contribution of Broca's area to chunking during the learning of a
               nonmotor sequence that does not involve language could shed new
               light on its function. To address this issue, we used offline
               MRI-guided TMS in healthy volunteers to disrupt the activity of
               either the posterior part of Broca's area (left Brodmann's area
               [BA] 44) or a control site just before participants learned a
               perceptual sequence structured in distinct hierarchical levels.
               We found that disruption of the left BA 44 increased the
               processing time of stimuli representing the boundaries of
               higher-order chunks and modified the chunking strategy. The
               current results highlight the possible role of the left BA 44 in
               building up effector-independent representations of higher-order

               provide a comprehensive overview of this literature and of the

               research with the Discrete Sequence Production (DSP) task as
               reported in well over 100 articles. In line with the increasing
               call for theory development, this culminates into proposing the
               second version of the Cognitive framework of Sequential Motor
               Behavior (C-SMB 2.0), which brings together known models from
               cognitive psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and motor learning.
               This processing framework accounts for the many different
               behavioral results obtained with the DSP task and unveils
               important properties of the cognitive system. C-SMB 2.0 assumes
               that a versatile central processor (CP) develops multimodal,
               central-symbolic representations of short motor segments by
               repeatedly storing the elements of these segments in short-term
               memory (STM). Independently, the repeated processing by
               modality-specific perceptual and motor processors (PPs and MPs)
               and by the CP when executing sequences gradually associates
               successively used representations at each processing level. The
               high dependency of these representations on active context
               information allows for the rapid serial activation of the
               sequence elements as well as for the executive control of tasks
               as a whole. Speculations are eventually offered as to how the

               may emerge when the skills of a person match the challenge of an
               activity. It is a special case of being on task, as during flow,
               keeping focused on the task feels effortless. Most experimental
               investigations of the neural or physiological correlates of flow
               contrast conditions with different levels of challenge. Yet
               comparing different levels of challenge that are too distant may
               trigger states where the participant is off task, such as boredom
               or frustration. Thus, it remains unclear whether previously
               observed differences ascribed to flow may rather reflect
               differences in how much participants were on task---trying their
               best---across the contrasted conditions. To remedy this, we
               introduce a method to manipulate flow by contrasting two video
               game play conditions at personalized levels of difficulty
               calibrated such that participants similarly tried their best in
               both conditions. Across three experiments (> 90 participants),
               higher flow was robustly reported in our high-flow than in our
               low-flow condition (mean effect size d = 1.31). Cardiac,
               respiratory, and skin conductance measures confirmed the known
               difference between a period of rest and the two on-task
               conditions of high and low flow, but failed to distinguish
               between these latter two. In light of the conflicting findings
               regarding the physiological correlates of flow, we discuss the
               importance of ensuring a low-flow baseline condition that
               maintains participants on task, and propose that the present
               method provides a methodological advance toward that goal.},

               employed in understanding other-produced language, the speech
               comprehension system, is also used to monitor one's own speech
               production. A conceptual, an inner, and an auditory loop convey
               information to a central, conscious monitor which scrutinizes the
               adequacy of the ongoing speech flow. In this model, only the
               end-products in the speech production sequences, the preverbal
               (propositional) message, the phonetic plan, and the auditory
               results, are verified. The production-based account assumes
               multiple local, autonomous monitoring devices, which can look
               inside formulation components. Moreover, these devices might be
               tuned to various signals from the actual speech motor execution,
               e.g. efferent, tactile, and proprioceptive feedback. Finally,
               node structure theory views error detection as a natural outflow
               of the activation patterns in the node system for speech
               production. Errors result in prolonged activation of uncommitted
               nodes, which in turn may incite error awareness. The approaches
               differ on the points of consciousness, volition and control, the
               number of monitoring channels, and their speed, flexibility, and
               capacity, and whether they can account for concurrent language
               comprehension disorders. From the empirical evidence presently
               available, it is argued for a central perception-based monitor,
               potentially augmented with a few automatic, production-based
               error detection devices.},

               expertise on cognitive interpreting, emphasizing time efficiency,
               accuracy, and cognitive effort, in alignment with prevailing
               expertise theories that link professional development and
               cognitive efficiency. The study assimilates empirical data from
               18 eye‐tracking studies conducted over the past four decades,
               encompassing a sample of 1581 interpreters. The objective is to
               elucidate the role of expertise in interpretative performance
               while tracing the evolution of these dynamics over time. Findings
               suggest that expert interpreters outperform novices in time
               efficiency and accuracy and exhibit lower cognitive effort,
               especially in sight and consecutive interpreting. This effect is
               particularly pronounced in the English‐Chinese language pair and
               with the use of E‐prime and Tobii eye‐tracking systems. Further,
               fixation count and pupil size are essential metrics impacting
               cognitive effort. These findings have vital implications for
               interpreter training programs, suggesting a focus on expertise
               development to enhance efficiency and accuracy, reduce cognitive
               load, and emphasize the importance of sight interpreting as a
               foundational skill. The selection of technology and understanding
               of specific ocular metrics also emerged as essential for future

	abstract = {Selecting suitable grasps on three-dimensional objects is a
               challenging visuomotor computation, which involves combining
               information about an object (e.g., its shape, size, and mass)
               with information about the actor's body (e.g., the optimal grasp
               aperture and hand posture for comfortable manipulation). Here we
               used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate brain
               networks associated with these distinct aspects during grasp
               planning and execution. Human participants of either sex viewed
               and then executed preselected grasps on L-shaped objects made of
               wood and/or brass. By leveraging a computational approach that
               accurately predicts human grasp locations, we selected grasp
               points that disentangled the role of multiple grasp-relevant
               factors: grasp axis, grasp size, and object mass.
               Representational Similarity Analysis revealed that grasp axis was
               encoded along dorsal-stream regions during grasp planning. Grasp
               size was first encoded in ventral-stream areas during grasp
               planning, then in premotor regions during grasp execution. Object
               mass was encoded in ventral-stream and (pre)motor regions only
               during grasp execution. Premotor regions further encoded visual
               predictions of grasp comfort, whereas the ventral stream encoded
               grasp comfort during execution, suggesting its involvement in
               haptic evaluation. These shifts in neural representations thus
               capture the sensorimotor transformations that allow humans to
               grasp objects.Significance StatementGrasping requires integrating
               object properties with constraints on hand and arm postures.
               Using a computational approach that accurately predicts human
               grasp locations by combining such constraints, we selected grasps
               on objects that disentangled the relative contributions of object
               mass, grasp size, and grasp axis during grasp planning and
               execution in a neuroimaging study. Our findings reveal a greater
               role of dorsal-stream visuomotor areas during grasp planning, and
               surprisingly, increasing ventral stream engagement during
               execution. We propose that during planning, visuomotor
               representations initially encode grasp axis and size. Perceptual
               representations of object material properties become more
               relevant instead as the hand approaches the object and motor
               programs are refined with estimates of the grip forces required
               to successfully lift the object.},

               development from the sensory-motor domain, we seek a neural
               process account for higher cognition in which all representations
               are necessarily grounded in perception and action. The challenge
               is to understand how hallmarks of higher cognition, productivity,
               systematicity, and compositionality, may emerge from such a
               bottom-up approach. To address this challenge, we present key
               ideas from Dynamic Field Theory which postulates that neural
               populations are organized by recurrent connectivity to create
               stable localist representations. Dynamic instabilities enable the
               autonomous generation of sequences of mental states. The capacity
               to apply neural circuitry across broad sets of inputs that
               emulates the function call postulated in symbolic computation
               emerges through coordinate transforms implemented in neural gain
               fields. We show how binding localist neural representations
               through a shared index dimension enables conceptual structure, in
               which the interdependence among components of a representation is
               flexibly expressed. We demonstrate these principles in a neural
               dynamic architecture that represents and perceptually grounds
               nested relational and action phrases. Sequences of neural
               processing steps are generated autonomously to attentionally
               select the referenced objects and events in a manner that is
               sensitive to their interdependencies. This solves the problem of
               2 and the massive binding problem in expressions such as ``the
               small tree that is to the left of the lake which is to the left
               of the large tree''. We extend earlier work by incorporating new
               types of grammatical constructions and a larger vocabulary. We
               discuss the DFT framework relative to other neural process
               accounts of higher cognition and assess the scope and challenges

               paradigm cases of habit which are used to derive five features as
               the basis for an explicative definition. It is argued that habits

               environmentally activated, and automatic. The enduring nature of
               habits is captured by their being dispositions of a certain sort.
               This is a realist account of habits insofar as the dispositions
               put forward must fit into some recognizable underlying system --
               in the case of humans a biological system -- to fill the role as
               set out by the definition. This role is wide-ranging; in addition

	abstract = {AbstractCognition has traditionally been understood in terms of
               internal mental representations, and computational operations
               carried out on internal mental representations. Radical
               approaches propose to reconceive cognition in terms of
               agent-environment dynamics. An outstanding challenge for such a
               philosophical project is how to scale-up from perception and
               action to cases of what is typically called `higher-order'
               cognition such as linguistic thought, the case we focus on in
               this paper. Perception and action are naturally described in
               terms of agent-environment dynamics, but can a person's thoughts
               about absent, abstract or counterfactual states of affairs also
               be accounted for in such terms? We argue such a question will
               seem pressing so long as one fails to appreciate how richly
               resourceful the human ecological niche is in terms of the
               affordances it provides. The explanatory work that is supposedly
               done by mental representations in a philosophical analysis of
               cognition, can instead be done by looking outside of the head to
               the environment structured by sociomaterial practices, and the
               affordances it makes available. Once one recognizes how much of
               the human ecological niche has become structured by activities of
               talking and writing, this should take away at least some of the
               motivation for understanding linguistic thinking in terms of
               content-bearing internal representations. We'll argue that people
               can think about absent, abstract or counterfactual because of
               their skills for engaging with what we will call ``enlanguaged
               affordances''. We make use of the phenomenological analysis of
               speech in Merleau-Ponty to show how the multiple affordances an
               individual is ready to engage with in a particular situation will
               typically include enlanguaged affordances.},

	abstract = {AbstractSkilful expertise is grounded in practical, performative
               knowledge-how, not in detached, spectatorial knowledge-that, and
               knowledge-how is embodied by habitual dispositions, not
               representation of facts and rules. Consequently, as action
               control is a key requirement for the intelligent selection,
               initiation, and regulation of skilful performance, habitual
               action control, i.e. the kind of action control based on habitual
               dispositions, is the true hallmark of skill and the only
               veridical criterion to evaluate expertise. Not only does this
               imply that knowledge-that does not make your actions more
               skilful, but it also implies that it makes them less skilful.
               This thesis, that I call Radical Habitualism, finds a precursor
               in Hubert Dreyfus. His approach is considered extreme by most
               philosophers of skill \& expertise: an agent --says Dreyfus-- does
               not perform like an expert when they lack the embodied
               dispositions necessary to control their action habitually or when
               they stop relying on such dispositions to control their actions.
               Thus, one cannot perform skilfully if their actions are guided by
               representations (isomorphic schemas, explicit rules, and
               contentful instructions), as the know-that that they convey
               disrupts or diminishes the agent's habitual engagement with the
               task at hand. In defence of Radical Habitualism, I will argue
               that only the contentless know-how embedded in habitual
               dispositions fulfils (i) the genetic, (ii) the normative, and
               (iii) the epistemic requirements of skilful performance. I will
               examine the phenomenological premises supporting Dreyfus'
               approach, clarify their significance for a satisfactory normative
               and explanatory account of skilful expertise, and rebut the most
               common objections raised by both intellectualists and
               conciliatory habitualists, concerning hybrid actions guided by a
               mix of habitual and representational forms of control. In
               revisiting Dreyfus anti-representationalist approach, I will
               particularly focus on its epistemological implications,
               de-emphasizing other considerations related to conscious
               awareness.},

	abstract = {Latent variable analyses of cognitive abilities are among the
               major means by which cognitive psychologists test theories
               regarding the structure of human cognition. Models are fit to
               observed variance-covariance structures, and the fit of those
               models are compared to assess the merits of competing theories.
               However, an often unconsidered and potentially important
               methodological issue is the precise sequence in which tasks are
               delivered to participants. Here we empirically tested whether
               differences in task sequences systematically affect the observed
               factor structure. A large sample (N = 587) completed a battery of
               12 cognitive tasks measuring four constructs: working memory,
               long-term memory, attention control, and fluid intelligence.
               Participants were assigned to complete the assessment in one of
               three sequences: fixed and grouped by construct vs. fixed and
               interleaved across constructs vs. random by participant. We
               generated and tested two hypotheses: grouping task sequences by
               construct (i.e., administering clusters of tasks measuring a
               cognitive construct consecutively) would (1) systematically
               increase factor loadings and (2) systematically decrease
               interfactor correlations. Neither hypothesis was supported. The
               measurement models were largely invariant across the three
               conditions, suggesting that latent variable analyses are robust
               to such subtle methodological differences as task sequencing.},

@article{Brown2023-tx,
	abstract = {AbstractWe examined how flexibly we plan sequences of actions
               when we switch between multiple action sequences. Mastering a
               sequential skill is assumed to involve integrating successive
               actions into groups known as chunks that can be efficiently
               planned and smoothly executed. Chunking is suggested by gains in
               planning efficiency for long compared to short action sequences
               following practice and learning associations between actions and
               perceptual outcomes. Less is understood about how efficiently we
               plan sequential chunks when we switch between multiple action
               sequences. Do we plan learned chunks less efficiently when we
               switch to a different action sequence? We examined this question
               by comparing the initiation and execution latencies of long
               versus short action sequences, performed from memory, when
               sequences switched or repeated across trials. Additionally, each
               action within the sequences generated predictable perceptual
               outcomes that were either spatially compatible or spatially
               incompatible with the action sequences. Results suggested
               repetition costs (instead of benefits) when performing long
               sequences. Repetition, as opposed to switching, prolonged
               initiation and increased the error rate of long compared to short
               sequences. We attribute these results to the flexible
               coordination of chunk planning and execution. Repetition may
               prolong advanced planning of long sequences in order to resolve
               conflict between multiple chunks, and switching may allow the
               planning of later chunks to be postponed until execution. We
               propose that the chunking of action sequences can both facilitate
               and interfere with action-switching performance.},

                   control to boost generalization and enable emergent semantic
                   reasoning. Our goal is to enable a single end-to-end trained
                   model to both learn to map robot observations to actions and
                   enjoy the benefits of large-scale pretraining on language and
                   vision-language data from the web. To this end, we propose to
                   co-fine-tune state-of-the-art vision-language models on both
                   robotic trajectory data and Internet-scale vision-language
                   tasks, such as visual question answering. In contrast to
                   other approaches, we propose a simple, general recipe to
                   achieve this goal: in order to fit both natural language
                   responses and robotic actions into the same format, we
                   express the actions as text tokens and incorporate them
                   directly into the training set of the model in the same way
                   as natural language tokens. We refer to such category of
                   models as vision-language-action models (VLA) and instantiate
                   an example of such a model, which we call RT-2. Our extensive
                   evaluation (6k evaluation trials) shows that our approach
                   leads to performant robotic policies and enables RT-2 to
                   obtain a range of emergent capabilities from Internet-scale
                   training. This includes significantly improved generalization
                   to novel objects, the ability to interpret commands not
                   present in the robot training data (such as placing an object
                   onto a particular number or icon), and the ability to perform
                   rudimentary reasoning in response to user commands (such as
                   picking up the smallest or largest object, or the one closest
                   to another object). We further show that incorporating chain
                   of thought reasoning allows RT-2 to perform multi-stage
                   semantic reasoning, for example figuring out which object to

               motor plans over successive movements are both essential for
               accurate, flexible motor behaviour. When an ongoing movement is
               off target, feedback control mechanisms update the descending
               motor commands to counter the sensed error. Over longer
               timescales, errors induce adaptation in feedforward planning so
               that future movements become more accurate and require less
               online adjustment from feedback control processes. Both the
               degree to which sensory feedback is integrated into an ongoing
               movement and the degree to which movement errors drive adaptive
               changes in feedforward motor plans have been shown to scale
               inversely with sensory uncertainty. However, since these
               processes have only been studied in isolation from one another,
               little is known about how they are influenced by sensory
               uncertainty in real-world movement contexts where they co-occur.
               Here, we show that sensory uncertainty may impact feedforward
               adaptation of reaching movements differently when feedback
               integration is present versus when it is absent. In particular,
               participants gradually adjust their movements from trial-to-trial
               in a manner that is well characterised by a slow and consistent
               envelope of error reduction. Riding on top of this slow envelope,
               participants exhibit large and abrupt changes in their initial
               movement vectors that are strongly correlated with the degree of
               sensory uncertainty present on the previous trial. However, these
               abrupt changes are insensitive to the magnitude and direction of
               the sensed movement error. These results prompt important
               questions for current models of sensorimotor learning under

              production system interleaves planning and articulation processes.
              Two experiments examined this assumption. In the first,
              participants stated the sums of two two-digit numbers in one of
              three different kinds of utterances, the sum by itself, the sum
              followed by the sequence ``is the answer,'' or the frame ``The answer
              is'' followed by the sum. Problem difficulty was manipulated as
              well, so that in some conditions, speakers could (in principle)
              state the tens component of the sum while planning the ones.
              Latencies to begin to speak were the same for all three utterance
              types and were affected by the difficulty of the problem as a
              whole. Utterance durations were unaffected by problem difficulty.
              In the second experiment, participants were induced to speak
              incrementally through the use of a deadline procedure. Both
              latencies and utterance durations were influenced by the
              difficulty of the problem. This latter finding supports a basic
              premise of the incremental approach: Speakers sometimes speak and

               masked-target/response pairs of randomly associated words and
               responses and of the type obtained by A. Allport (1977). Judges
               did not distinguish the 2 kinds of word pairs. Despite these
               negative findings, a final pair of experiments replicated
               Marcel's demonstration that masked words, no less than unmasked
               words, facilitate lexical decisions concerning subsequently
               presented semantically related words. Graphic and phonetic

               a critical aspect of successful motor activity. While motor
               performance typically improves with learning, it is unclear
               whether, how, and why higher order aspects of motor cognition are
               also affected. Here, we used an implicit measure of sense of
               agency-the 'intentional binding' effect-as participants learned
               to make a skilled action involving precise control of thumb
               adduction. These actions were predictably followed by a tone (the
               outcome). At pre-test, we showed the perceived time of the tone
               was shifted towards the thumb action, compared to a control
               condition in which tones occurred without actions. Next, a
               relevant training group learned to refine the direction of the
               thumb movement, while an irrelevant training group was trained on
               another movement. Manipulation checks demonstrated that, as
               expected, the relevant training group improved performance of the
               trained movement, while the irrelevant training group did not.
               Critically, while both groups still showed binding of the tone
               towards the thumb action at post-test, the relevant training
               group showed less binding than the irrelevant training group.
               Given the link between intentional binding and volitional control
               of action, we suggest our result demonstrates subjective agency
               over the outcome of a skilled action decreases as practice makes
               the skilled action more fluent. We suggest that this reduction in
               sense of agency over movement outcomes is consistent with the
               decreasing cognitive engagement, or automatization, that occurs
               during skill learning.},

               goals influence voluntary and involuntary movements at similar
               latencies. The objectives of this study were to determine how
               long it takes to prepare a motor action and to compare this time
               for voluntary and involuntary movements. We hypothesized a
               prepared motor action would influence voluntarily and
               involuntarily initiated movements at the same latency. We trained
               subjects to reach with a forced reaction time paradigm and used a
               startling acoustic stimulus (SAS) to trigger involuntary
               initiation of the same reaches. The time available to prepare was
               controlled by varying when one of four reach targets was
               presented. Reach direction was used to evaluate accuracy. We
               quantified the time between target presentation and the cue or
               trigger for movement initiation. We found that reaches were
               accurately initiated when the target was presented 48 ms before
               the SAS and 162 ms before the cue to voluntarily initiate
               movement. While the SAS precisely controlled the latency of
               movement onset, voluntary reach onset was more variable. We,
               therefore, quantified the time between target presentation and
               movement onset and found no significant difference in the time
               required to plan reaches initiated voluntarily or involuntarily
               (∆ = 8 ms, p = 0.2). These results demonstrate that the time

               they are initiated voluntarily or triggered involuntarily. This

	abstract = {As children gradually master grammatical rules, they often go
              through a period of producing form-meaning associations that were
              not observed in the input. For example, 2- to 3-year-old
              English-learning children use the bare form of verbs in settings
              that require obligatory past tense meaning while already starting
              to produce the grammatical -ed inflection. While many studies have
              focused on overgeneralization errors, fewer studies have attempted
              to explain the root of this earlier stage of rule acquisition. In
              this work, we use computational modeling to replicate children's
              production behavior prior to the generalization of past tense
              production in English. We illustrate how seemingly erroneous
              productions emerge in a model, without being licensed in the
              grammar and despite the model aiming at conforming to grammatical
              forms. Our results show that bare form productions stem from a
              tension between two factors: (1) trying to produce a less frequent
              meaning (the past tense) and (2) being unable to restrict the
              production of frequent forms (the bare form) as learning
              progresses. Like children, our model goes through a stage of bare
              form production and then converges on adult-like production of the

@article{Glaser2005-kv,
	abstract = {After nearly three decades of research on automaticity and
               construct activation, it is increasingly clear that much of human
               mental life operates without awareness or intent. In the
               literature of cognitive psychology, automatic processes are held
               to be inevitably evoked by the presence of a relevant
               environmental stimulus; once triggered, their execution proceeds
               rapidly, effortlessly, and incorrigibly to completion, leaving no
               traces accessible to conscious recollection. The unconscious, in
               addition to being a passive categorizer, evaluator, and semantic
               processor, has processing goals (e.g., accuracy, egalitarianism)
               of its own, can be vigilant for threats to the attainment of
               these goals, and will proactively compensate for such threats.
               One might call this ``compensatory automaticity''; strategic yet
               nonconscious compensations for unintended thoughts, feelings, or
               behaviors. Evidence from studies of automatic affect (e.g.,
               Glaser \& Banaji, 1999) and cognition (e.g., Moskowitz et al.,
               1999) suggests that, in addition to the ability to process the
               meaning of, categorize, and evaluate perceived stimuli
               automatically, the human mind is capable of maintaining
               unconscious vigilance over its own automatic processes. This
               suggests a volitional nature of the unconscious, an idea that to
               many may seem self-contradictory. In the construct activation
               literature so central to social cognitive theory and research,
               the unconscious has been credited with (or blamed for, as the
               case may be) simplistic, assimilative influences on judgments,
               while the compensatory efforts necessary to obtain contrast
               effects have been ascribed strictly to deliberate, conscious
               processes (e.g., Wilson \& Brekke, 1994). However, when observed
               in responses that most likely reflect automatic processes,
               ``contrast'' effects stemming from correction (e.g., Glaser \&
               Banaji, 1999) indicate that people can unconsciously monitor and
               correct for bias in judgments, just as they might consciously.
               That goals can operate at the unconscious level, and subsequently
               influence explicit judgments and behaviors, is now well
               demonstrated (e.g., Bargh \& Barndollar, 1996; Bargh et al.,
               2001; Chartrand \& Bargh, 1996). Evidence that corrective
               processes can occur even when a person is unaware that she is
               making a judgment, as in the case of a priming procedure with a
               nonreactive response task (i.e., the pronunciation task), and
               especially considering that accuracy motivation moderates such
               automatic compensatory effects (Glaser, 2003; Wentura, 2000),
               however, implicates unconscious, metacognitive processing goals.
               Similarly, demonstrations of the effects of chronic ideological
               goals (e.g., egalitarianism) on suppressing automatic, and
               therefore previously presumed uncontrollable, responses
               (Moskowitz et al., 1999) bolster the thesis of unconscious
               volition. Building on the trend to allow for a full spectrum of
               mental life (i.e., affect, cognition, and motivation) in the
               unconscious (Bargh, 1996, 1997; Kihlstrom, 1987, 1999), we go a
               step further to suggest that the unconscious is indeed capable of
               holding such metacognitive processing goals (e.g., accuracy)
               which it will pursue through self-monitoring, and that it will,
               under some conditions, compensate for anticipated threats to the
               attainment of those goals. This thesis, and the findings
               supporting it, represents a departure from traditional
               conceptions of the unconscious as passive and reactive,
               suggesting an unconscious that is, paradoxically, ``aware.''

               links conscious and automatic processes through a complementary
               postconscious activity that is rooted in the cognitive mechanism

               underlying mental representations connects these processes to

               prove beneficial but in a few rare cases could prove detrimental.

               tasks are performed together with other control tasks, that is,

               is also observed if control tasks are preceded by other control
               tasks, that is, if sequential cognitive control is required. The
               typical explanation for the latter finding is that previous acts
               of cognitive control deplete a common resource, just like a
               muscle becomes fatigued after repeated usage. An alternative
               explanation, however, is that previous acts of cognitive control
               reduce motivation to match allocated resources to required

               partly because cognitive influences of language have rarely been

               manipulate the level of visual processing. This study presents a
               novel combination of a high-level approach upregulating the
               involvement of language, namely self-paced sentence-video

              experiments, we have tested whether predicted words are indeed
              inhibited when listeners encounter unexpected stimuli, and whether
              the linguistic status (word or sound) and semantic congruency of a
              word (plausible or implausible) influences this purported
              inhibitory process. Using a Cross-Modal Lexical Priming paradigm,
              we showed that when predictions are violated, the activation of
              the predicted word is inhibited, resulting in increased reaction
              times. These inhibitory effects appear to be language specific, in
              that they are only observed after unexpected words, as opposed to
              non-linguistic sounds (tones). However, contrary to a long-held
              assumption in the field of sentence processing, inhibitory effects
              are not modulated by the semantic congruency of the unexpected
              word (i.e., whether the unexpected word is plausible within the
              sentence context). Indeed, in the current study, any linguistic
              information that violated listeners' semantic prediction resulted
              in the inhibition of the predicted word. Thus, the current
              findings are more compatible with a view in which unexpected
              linguistic events that are meaningful engage inhibitory processes
              with the specific purpose of inhibiting the predicted, though
              out-of-date, word.},

               Young and older speakers showed comparable speaking latencies in

               latencies than young speakers in word production task. Eye
               movement data showed that compared with young speakers, older
               speakers had higher fixation percentage on object 1, lower
               percentage of gaze shift from object 1 to 2, and lower fixation

               replicate effects---crucially both large and small---that
               tracker-based eye tracking has shown. Using the Gorilla

               psycholinguistic effects: a robust one, the verb semantic
               constraint effect, first reported in Altmann and Kamide,
               Cognition 73(3), 247--264 (1999), and a smaller one, the lexical

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Language and communication are fundamental to the
              human experience, and, traditionally, spoken language is studied
              as an isolated skill. However, before propositional language
              (i.e., spontaneous, voluntary, novel speech) can be produced,
              propositional content or 'ideas' must be formulated. OBJECTIVE:
              This review highlights the role of broader cognitive processes,
              particularly 'executive attention', in the formulation of
              propositional content (i.e., 'ideas') for propositional language
              production. CONCLUSIONS: Several key lines of evidence converge to
              suggest that the formulation of ideas for propositional language
              production draws on executive attentional processes. Larger-scale
              clinical research has demonstrated a link between attentional
              processes and language, while detailed case studies of
              neurological patients have elucidated specific idea formulation
              mechanisms relating to the generation, selection and sequencing of
              ideas for expression. Furthermore, executive attentional processes
              have been implicated in the generation of ideas for propositional
              language production. Finally, neuroimaging studies suggest that a
              widely distributed network of brain regions, including parts of
              the prefrontal and parietal cortices, supports propositional
              language production. IMPLICATIONS: Theoretically driven
              experimental research studies investigating mechanisms involved in
              the formulation of ideas are lacking. We suggest that novel
              experimental approaches are needed to define the contribution of
              executive attentional processes to idea formulation, from which
              comprehensive models of spoken language production can be
              developed. Clinically, propositional language impairments should
              be considered in the context of broader executive attentional
              deficits.},

               his word comprehension, word repetition and reading skills were
               intact. We documented the efficacy of different types of cues for
               name retrieval. Phonological and semantic cues were either
               ineffective or had a minor effect. By contrast a sentence frame
               even a low probability sentence frame (e.g. I went to the shop to
               buy a ...?) had a very significant facilitatory effect for object
               naming. In a series of experiments we explored the basis of this
               facilitation. It was shown that neither a picture frame, an
               associated verb, nor a syntactically correct but semantically
               meaningless sentence frame were effective cues. Our findings

               an on-line language processor that constructs propositional
               speech. It is the integrity of this latter system that could
               account for the facilitation of naming by a sentence frame in

              malignant left frontal meningioma impinging upon Brodmann area 45,
              presented a 'pure' dynamic aphasia. Her spontaneous speech was
              markedly reduced in the absence of any syntactical impairment. Her
              naming, repetition and reading skills were completely normal. Two
              experimental investigations were carried out. The first
              investigation found that A.N.G. had a profound impairment in
              phrase and sentence generation tasks given a verbal context.
              However, her verbal generative skills were normal when she was
              asked to describe pictorial scenes and complex actions. Moreover,
              it was found that A.N.G. had no difficulty ordering the
              constituent words of a sentence. Thus, it was concluded that her
              verbal planning skills were intact. The second investigation
              tested a hypothesis that dynamic aphasia is due to an inability to
              select a verbal response option whenever the stimulus activates
              many competing verbal responses. Predictions based upon this
              hypothesis were confirmed on three different verbal generation
              tasks. It was found that our patient's grave verbal generative
              impairment was present for tasks involving stimuli which activate
              many potential responses. However, it was absent for tasks
              involving stimuli which activate few or only a single 'prepotent'

              a computational model of prefrontal cortex functioning, we propose
              that pure dynamic aphasia may be caused by damage to a 'context'
              module containing units responsible for selection of verbal
              response options. Moreover, it is suggested that our findings
              support the view that Brodmann area 45 is involved in verbal

	abstract = {People with aphasia demonstrate language impairments evident in
              both performance accuracy and processing speed, but the direct
              relationship between accuracy and speed requires further
              consideration. This article describes two recent attempts to make
              quantitative progress in this domain using response time modeling:
              the diffusion model (Ratcliff, 1978) applied to two-choice tasks
              and a multinomial ex-Gaussian model applied to picture naming. The
              diffusion model may be used to characterize core linguistic
              processing efficiency and speed-accuracy tradeoffs independently,
              and research suggests that maladaptive speed-accuracy tradeoffs
              lead to performance impairments in at least some people with

              question, we asked Japanese speakers to describe
              computer-generated animations of simple actions with variation in

              explain these findings, a deep-learning model of verb production

               subjects were presented with a green dot on a computer screen,

               trials, the location or the color of the target was altered at
               the onset of movement to this stimulus, requiring the participant
               to modify the initially programmed response according to specific
               motor instructions. In the 'location-go' group, the target

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a
              neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive language
              impairment. The three variants of PPA include the
              nonfluent/agrammatic, semantic, and logopenic types. The goal of
              this report is to describe two patients with a loss of speech
              initiation that was associated with bilateral medial frontal
              atrophy. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two patients with progressive speech
              deficits were evaluated and their examinations revealed a paucity
              of spontaneous speech; however their naming, repetition, reading,
              and writing were all normal. The patients had no evidence of
              agrammatism or apraxia of speech but did have impaired speech
              fluency. In addition to impaired production of propositional
              spontaneous speech, these patients had impaired production of
              automatic speech (e.g., reciting the Lord's Prayer) and singing.
              Structural brain imaging revealed bilateral medial frontal atrophy
              in both patients. CONCLUSION: These patients' language deficits
              are consistent with a PPA, but they are in the pattern of a
              dynamic aphasia. Whereas the signs-symptoms of dynamic aphasia
              have been previously described, to our knowledge these are the
              first cases associated with predominantly bilateral medial frontal
              atrophy that impaired both propositional and automatic speech.
              Thus, this profile may represent a new variant of PPA.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is an
              akinetic-rigid syndrome of unknown aetiology which usually
              presents with a combination of unsteadiness, bradykinesia, and
              disordered eye movement. Speech often becomes dysarthric but
              language disorders are not well recognised. METHODS: Three
              patients with PSP (pathologically confirmed in two) are reported
              in which the presenting symptoms were those of difficulty with
              language output. RESULTS: Neuropsychological testing showed
              considerable impairment on a range of single word tasks which
              require active initiation and search strategies (letter and
              category fluency, sentence completion), and on tests of narrative
              language production. By contrast, naming from pictures and from
              verbal descriptions, and word and sentence comprehension were
              largely intact. The degree of semantic memory impairment was also
              slight. CONCLUSIONS: Relatively selective involvement of cognitive
              processes critical for planning and initiating language output may
              occur in some patients with PSP. This presentation resembles the
              phenomenon of ``verbal adynamia'' or ``dynamic aphasia'' seen in
              patients with frontal lobe damage. Although definite cortical
              changes were present at postmortem examination, it is likely that
              the neuropsychological deficits reflect functional frontal
              deafferentation secondary to interruption of frontostriatal
              feedback loops.},

               disorder of propositional language in association with
               progressive frontal lobe degeneration. The salient clinical
               feature was her marked difficulty in responding to open-ended
               questions, contrasting with the relative preservation of
               performance on more closed, structured language tasks.
               Experimental investigations of her language skills revealed
               significant temporal organizational difficulties. She could
               generate sentences in sentence completion tasks, although there
               were errors in thematic role assignment and temporal ordering.
               She had profound difficulty rearranging written words to form a
               sentence, despite producing the sentence orally. She was unable
               to conjoin sentences with an appropriate conjunction. The nature

	abstract = {Frontal dynamic aphasia is characterised by a profound reduction
              in spontaneous speech despite well-preserved naming, repetition
              and comprehension. Since Luria (1966, 1970) designated this term,
              two main forms of dynamic aphasia have been identified: one, a
              language-specific selection deficit at the level of word/sentence
              generation, associated with left inferior frontal lesions; and
              two, a domain-general impairment in generating multiple responses
              or connected speech, associated with more extensive bilateral
              frontal and/or frontostriatal damage. Both forms of dynamic
              aphasia have been interpreted as arising due to disturbances in
              early prelinguistic conceptual preparation mechanisms that are
              critical for language production. We investigate language-specific
              and domain-general accounts of dynamic aphasia and address two
              issues: one, whether deficits in multiple conceptual preparation
              mechanisms can co-occur; and two, the contribution of broader
              cognitive processes such as energization, the ability to initiate
              and sustain response generation over time, to language generation
              failure. Thus, we report patient WAL who presented with frontal
              dynamic aphasia in the context of progressive supranuclear palsy
              (PSP). WAL was given a series of experimental tests that showed
              that his dynamic aphasia was not underpinned by a
              language-specific deficit in selection or in microplanning. By
              contrast, WAL presented with a domain-general deficit in fluent
              sequencing of novel thoughts. The latter replicated the pattern
              documented in a previous PSP patient (Robinson, et al., 2006);
              however, unique to WAL, generating novel thoughts was impaired but
              there was no evidence of a sequencing deficit because
              perseveration was absent. Thus, WAL is the first unequivocal case
              to show a distinction between novel thought generation and
              subsequent fluent sequencing. Moreover, WAL's generation deficit
              encompassed verbal and non-verbal responses, showing a similar
              (but more profoundly reduced) pattern of performance to frontal
              patients with an energization deficit. In addition to impaired
              generation of novel thoughts, WAL presented with a concurrent
              strategy generation deficit, both falling within the second form
              of dynamic aphasia comprised of domain-general conceptual
              preparation mechanisms. Thus, within this second form of dynamic
              aphasia, concurrent deficits can co-occur. Overall, WAL presented
              with the second form of dynamic aphasia and was impaired in the
              generation of novel thoughts and internally-generated strategies,
              in the context of PSP and bilateral frontostriatal damage.},

              the hallmark propositional language impairment in the context of
              preserved naming, reading, repetition and comprehension skills.
              The severity of KAS's propositional language deficit was
              demonstrated to be comparable to other dynamic aphasic patients.
              Remarkably, despite virtually abolished propositional speech, KAS
              was unimpaired on word and sentence level generation tasks that
              required a single response. This dissociation was further
              investigated on two discourse level generation tasks that required
              the generation of multiple connected sentences. Quantitative
              production analysis and novelty measures demonstrated that her
              performance was extremely reduced and characterised by a lack of
              novel words and sentences and a tendency to perseverate. This
              pattern of performance suggests that there may be two subtypes of

              Patients with the second subtype, like KAS, pass word and sentence
              level generation tests and fail discourse level generation tests.
              They have a verbal and non-verbal generation deficit and bilateral

              to account for a specific language impairment termed dynamic
              aphasia. We report a patient (CH) who presented with a dynamic
              aphasia in the context of nonfluent progressive aphasia. CH had
              the hallmark of reduced spontaneous speech in the context of
              preserved naming, reading, and single word repetition and
              comprehension. Articulatory and grammatical difficulties were also
              present. CH had a very severe verbal generation impairment despite
              being able to describe pictorial scenes and action sequences well.
              In the experimental investigations CH was severely impaired in
              word, phrase, and sentence generation tasks when many competing
              responses were activated by a stimulus. By contrast, he could
              generate verbal responses satisfactorily when a dominant response
              was activated by a stimulus. For the first time, we demonstrated
              that the verbal generation impairment was specific to the
              production of language. Strikingly, our patient was unimpaired on
              a number of nonverbal generation tasks (e.g., design fluency,
              gesture fluency, and motor movement generation). MRI revealed
              focal left frontal atrophy that predominantly affected Brodmann's
              Areas 44 and 45. Our findings are discussed with reference to
              alternative accounts of dynamic aphasia and models of speech
              production. We interpret our patient's impairment as being
              underpinned by an inability to select between competing verbal
              response options. This interpretation converges with evidence from
              the neuroimaging literature, which implicates the left inferior
              frontal gyrus in the selection of a response among competing
              information. We conclude that the left posterior inferior frontal
              gyrus is involved in the generation of verbal output, and
              specifically in the selection between competing verbal responses.},

               frequency of use, it is often suggested that at least some
               aspects of language processing are highly overlearned and
               therefore occur ``automatically''. Here we critically examine this
               suggestion. We first sketch a framework that views automaticity
               as a set of interrelated features of mental processes and a
               matter of degree rather than a single feature that is
               all-or-none. We then apply this framework to language processing.
               To do so, we carve up the processes involved in language use
               according to (a) whether language processing takes place in
               monologue or dialogue, (b) whether the individual is
               comprehending or producing language, (c) whether the spoken or

               superimposed objects was briefly presented. One second later a

              8 character-classification experiments with 76 Ss. The
              classification task was either performed alone or in the retention
              interval of a short-term memory task which required ordered recall

              on the amount of practice with specific target sets. The remaining

              research on memory performance in normal college students. One
              basic assumption is that encoding operations vary in their
              attentional requirements. Operations that drain minimal energy
              from limited-capacity attentional mechanisms are called automatic.
              Automatic operations function at a constant level under all
              circumstances, occur without intention, and do not benefit from
              practice. Effortful operations, such as rehearsal and elaborative
              mnemonic activities, require considerable capacity, interfere with
              other cognitive activities also requiring capacity, are initiated

	abstract = {Traditional views of automaticity are in need of revision. For
              example, automaticity often has been treated as an all-or-none
              phenomenon, and traditional theories have held that automatic
              processes are independent of attention. Yet recent empirical data
              suggest that automatic processes are continuous, and furthermore
              are subject to attentional control. A model of attention is
              presented to address these issues. Within a parallel distributed
              processing framework, it is proposed that the attributes of
              automaticity depend on the strength of a processing pathway and
              that strength increases with training. With the Stroop effect as
              an example, automatic processes are shown to be continuous and to
              emerge gradually with practice. Specifically, a computational
              model of the Stroop task simulates the time course of processing
              as well as the effects of learning. This was accomplished by
              combining the cascade mechanism described by McClelland (1979)
              with the backpropagation learning algorithm (Rumelhart, Hinton, \&
              Williams, 1986). The model can simulate performance in the
              standard Stroop task, as well as aspects of performance in
              variants of this task that manipulate stimulus-onset asynchrony,
              response set, and degree of practice. The model presented is
              contrasted against other models, and its relation to many of the
              central issues in the literature on attention, automaticity, and
              interference is discussed.},

              fleshing out a larger speech production architecture for encoding
              phonological tone. A corpus was created by extracting 2462 speech
              errors, including 668 tone errors, from audio recordings of
              natural conversations. The structure of these errors was then
              investigated in order to distinguish two contemporary approaches
              to tone in speech production. In the tonal frames account, tone is
              encoded like metrical stress, represented in abstract structural
              frames for a word. Because tone cannot be mis-selected in tonal
              frames, tone errors are expected to be rare and non-contextual, as
              observed with stress. An alternative is that tone is actively
              selected in phonological encoding like phonological segments. This
              approach predicts that tone errors will be relatively common and
              exhibit the contextual patterns observed with segments, like
              perseveration and anticipation. In our corpus, tone errors are the
              second most common type of error, and the majority of errors
              exhibit contextual patterns that parallel segmental errors.
              Building on prior research, a two-stage model of phonological tone
              encoding is proposed, following the patterns seen in tone errors:
              Tone is phonologically selected concurrently with segments, but

                 that a variable alternationwhich is conditioned by the nature
                 of the element that follows it can have this conditioning
                 disrupted when a speaker fails to plan what that following
                 element will be (Wagner 2011, Tanner et al. 2015). The strength
                 ofthe effect of that following element on the variable
                 alternation thus diminishes the less likely advance planning
                 is. I extend this research, which has so far only examined
                 following phonological elements, to look at whether this
                 finding holds when a following element effect is localized in
                 the syntactic domain.Taking is-contraction as my dependent
                 variable, I first provide a detailed account of the role of
                 followingconstituent category in conditioning this variable,
                 documenting a robust effect in Mainstream AmericanEnglish with
                 a hierarchy of environments very similar to what has been found
                 in studies of the contraction and deletion ofis in African
                 American English. I then investigate an acoustic proxy for
                 advance planning (duration of the word following is) and find
                 that, while it does play a role in conditioning contraction, it
                 does notinteract with the following constituent effect. I
                 connect this finding to the proposal that advance planningscope
                 differs for d ifferent levels of grammar (Wagner et al. 2010).
                 More broadly, I underscore that thepatterning of

	abstract = {Devoicing of high vowels (HVD) in Tokyo Japanese applies in two
              environments---between voiceless consonants, and between a voiceless
              consonant and a ``pause''---and applies variably as a function of a
              number of factors. The role and definition of ``pause'' in this
              process, in terms of a physical pause or prosodic position (word
              or phrase boundary), remains unclear, as does what is expected
              when these environments overlap, and why HVD appears to be
              categorical in some environments and variable in others. This
              paper addresses three outstanding issues about HVD---the role of
              ``boundary phenomena'' (prosodic position and physical pauses), the
              relationship between the two environments, and the sources of
              variability in HVD---by examining vowel devoicing in a large corpus
              of spontaneous Japanese. We use mixed-effects logistic regression
              to model how boundary phenomena affect the likelihood of devoicing
              and modulate the effects of other variables, controlling for other
              major factors, including a measure of gestural overlap. The
              results suggest that all boundary phenomena jointly affect
              devoicing rate, and that prosodic phrase boundaries play a key
              role: variability in HVD looks qualitatively different for
              phrase-internal and phrase-final vowels, which are affected
              differently by word frequency, speech rate, and pause duration. We
              argue the results support an account of HVD as the result of two
              overlapping vowel devoicing processes, each widely-attested
              cross-linguistically: devoicing between voiceless consonants, and
              devoicing before prosodic phrase boundaries. Variability in the
              application of these two processes can then be partially explained
              in terms of aspects of phonetic implementation and processing:
              gestural overlap (Beckman 1996), which often plays a role in
              reduction processes, and the locality of production planning
              (Wagner 2012), a recent explanation for variability in the

               strongly conditioned by whether the following segment is a
               consonant or a vowel. This paper uses corpus data to show that
               this following segment effect is weaker across strong syntactic
               boundaries (such as between independent matrix clauses) than
               across weak syntactic boundaries (between a verb and its direct
               object). This result is argued to be compatible with the
               Production Planning Hypothesis: that following context effects on
               phonological variation can be bled by failure to encode the next
               word in time for it to influence an alternation. Further, the
               interaction of boundary and following segment is asymmetric; the
               deletion-inhibiting effect of a following vowel is significantly
               weakened across stronger syntactic boundaries, while the deletion
               rate before consonants is more stable across different boundary
               types. The asymmetry provides new evidence in favor of
               syllabification-based explanations for why coronal stop deletion
               exhibits the following segment effect.},

              predicts that language production is affected by a preference to
              distribute information uniformly across the linguistic signal.
              This prediction is tested against data from syntactic reduction. A

              of syntactic structures. The merits of a corpus-based approach to

	abstract = {Lexical ambiguity is widespread in language, allowing for the
               reuse of economical word forms and therefore making language more
               efficient. If ambiguous words cannot be disambiguated from
               context, however, this gain in efficiency might make language
               less clear---resulting in frequent miscommunication. For a
               language to be clear and efficiently encoded, we posit that the
               lexical ambiguity of a word type should correlate with how much
               information context provides about it, on average. To investigate
               whether this is the case, we operationalise the lexical ambiguity
               of a word as the entropy of meanings it can take, and provide two
               ways to estimate this---one which requires human annotation
               (using WordNet), and one which does not (using BERT), making it
               readily applicable to a large number of languages. We validate
               these measures by showing that, on six high-resource languages,
               there are significant Pearson correlations between our BERT-based
               estimate of ambiguity and the number of synonyms a word has in
               WordNet (e.g. $\rho = 0.40$ in English). We then test our main
               hypothesis---that a word's lexical ambiguity should negatively
               correlate with its contextual uncertainty---and find significant
               correlations on all 18 typologically diverse languages we
               analyse. This suggests that, in the presence of ambiguity,
               speakers compensate by making contexts more informative.},

                   language generation community for the last few years. In this
                   work, we posit that the abstraction of natural language
                   generation as a discrete stochastic process--which allows for
                   an information-theoretic analysis--can provide new insights
                   into the behavior of probabilistic language generators, e.g.,
                   why high-probability texts can be dull or repetitive. Humans
                   use language as a means of communicating information, aiming
                   to do so in a simultaneously efficient and error-minimizing
                   manner; in fact, psycholinguistics research suggests humans
                   choose each word in a string with this subconscious goal in
                   mind. We formally define the set of strings that meet this
                   criterion: those for which each word has an information
                   content close to the expected information content, i.e., the
                   conditional entropy of our model. We then propose a simple
                   and efficient procedure for enforcing this criterion when
                   generating from probabilistic models, which we call locally
                   typical sampling. Automatic and human evaluations show that,

                   sampling offers competitive performance (in both abstractive

              to directly predict this phenomenon. In this work, we focus on a
              class of algorithms whose runtime does naturally scale in
              surprisal---those that involve repeatedly sampling from the prior.
              Our first contribution is to show that simple examples of such
              algorithms predict runtime to increase superlinearly with
              surprisal, and also predict variance in runtime to increase. These
              two predictions stand in contrast with literature on surprisal
              theory (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008), which assumes that the expected
              processing cost increases linearly with surprisal, and makes no
              prediction about variance. In the second part of this paper, we
              conduct an empirical study of the relationship between surprisal
              and reading time, using a collection of modern language models to

               Specifically, we re-examine an established generalization ---the

              task-general communicative constraints and evolve under pressure
              to optimize the Information Bottleneck (IB) tradeoff between the
              informativeness and complexity of the lexicon. Here, we integrate
              these two approaches by trading off utility, informativeness, and
              complexity in EC. To this end, we propose Vector-Quantized
              Variational Information Bottleneck (VQ-VIB), a method for training
              neural agents to encode inputs into discrete signals embedded in a

              reinforcement learning settings and in color reference games and

              patients with subcortical lesions of the striatum have language
              difficulties. We investigated whether the striatum is directly
              involved in language or whether its role in decision-making has an
              indirect effect on language performance, by testing carriers of
              Huntington's disease (HD) mutations and controls. HD is a genetic
              neurodegenerative disease primarily affecting the striatum and

              in the premanifest (before clinical diagnosis) and early disease
              stages, and controls to perform two discrimination tasks, one
              involving linguistic and the other non-linguistic stimuli. We used
              the hierarchical drift diffusion model (HDDM) to analyze the
              participants' responses and to assess the decision and
              non-decision parameters separately. We hypothesized that any
              language deficits related to decision-making impairments would be
              reflected in the decision parameters of linguistic and
              non-linguistic tasks. We also assessed the relative contributions

              discriminability). Finally, we investigated whether the decision
              and non-decision parameters of the HDDM were correlated with brain
              atrophy. The HDDM analysis showed that patients with early HD have
              impaired decision parameters relative to controls, regardless of
              the task. In both tasks, decision parameters better explained the
              variance of response time and discriminability performance than
              non-decision parameters. In the linguistic task, decision
              parameters were positively correlated with gray matter volume in
              the ventral striatum and putamen, whereas non-decision parameters
              were not. Language impairment in patients with striatal atrophy is
              better explained by a deficit of decision-making than by a deficit

              898 object-scene pairs (e.g., suitcase-airport), with object and
              scene presented separately. Our goal was twofold. First, to create
              a database of object and scene pictures, normed for the same
              variables to have comparable measures for both types of pictures.
              Second, to acquire normative data for the semantic relationships
              between objects and scenes presented separately, which offers more
              flexibility in the use of the pictures and allows disentangling
              the processing of the object and its context (the scene). Along
              three experiments, participants evaluated each object or scene
              picture on name agreement, familiarity, and visual complexity, and
              rated object-scene pairs on semantic congruency. A total of 125
              septuplets of one scene and six objects (three congruent, three
              incongruent), and 120 triplets of one object and two scenes (in
              congruent and incongruent pairings) were built. In future studies,
              these objects and scenes can be used separately or combined, while
              controlling for their key features. Additionally, as object-scene
              pairs received semantic congruency ratings along the entire scale,
              researchers may select among a wide range of congruency values.

@article{Rens2023-lp,
	abstract = {In daily life, prehension is typically not the end goal of
               hand-object interactions but a precursor for manipulation.
               Nevertheless, functional MRI (fMRI) studies investigating manual
               manipulation have primarily relied on prehension as the end goal
               of an action. Here, we used slow event-related fMRI to
               investigate differences in neural activation patterns between
               prehension in isolation and prehension for object manipulation.
               Sixteen (7 males and 9 females) participants were instructed
               either to simply grasp the handle of a rotatable dial (isolated
               prehension) or to grasp and turn it (prehension for object
               manipulation). We used representational similarity analysis to
               investigate whether the experimental conditions could be
               discriminated from each other based on differences in
               task-related brain activation patterns. We also used temporal
               multivoxel pattern analysis to examine the evolution of regional
               activation patterns over time. Importantly, we were able to
               differentiate isolated prehension and prehension for manipulation
               from activation patterns in the early visual cortex, the caudal
               intraparietal sulcus, and the superior parietal lobule. Our
               findings indicate that object manipulation extends beyond the
               putative cortical grasping network (anterior intraparietal
               sulcus, premotor and motor cortices) to include the superior
               parietal lobule and early visual cortex.Significance statement:A
               simple act such as turning an oven dial requires not only that
               the central nervous system encode the initial state (starting
               dial orientation) of the object but also the appropriate posture
               to grasp it in order to achieve the desired end state (final dial
               orientation) and the motor commands to achieve that state. Using
               advanced temporal neuroimaging analysis techniques, we reveal how
               such actions unfold over time and how they differ between object
               manipulation (turning a dial) vs. grasping alone. We find that a
               combination of brain areas implicated in visual processing and
               sensorimotor integration can distinguish between the complex and
               simple tasks during planning, with neural patterns that
               approximate those during the actual execution of the action.},

              ``higher-order'' cognition as fundamentally embodied and enacted.
              Merleau-Ponty's philosophy inspired theories that deemphasize
              overlaps between conceptual knowledge and motor intentionality or,
              on the contrary, focus exclusively on abstract thought. In
              contrast, this paper explores the link between Merleau-Ponty's
              account of motor intentionality and his interpretations of our
              capacity to understand and interact productively with cultural
              symbolic systems. I develop my interpretation based on
              Merleau-Ponty's analysis of two neuropathological modifications of
              motor intentionality, the case of the brain-injured war veteran
              Schneider, and a neurological disorder known as Gerstmann's
              syndrome. Building on my analysis of Schneider's sensorimotor
              compensatory performances in relation to his limitations in the
              domains of algebra, geometry, and language usage, I demonstrate a
              strong continuity between the sense of embodiment and enaction at
              all these levels. Based on Merleau-Ponty's interpretations, I
              argue that ``higher-order'' cognition is impaired in Schneider
              insofar as his injury limits his sensorimotor capacity to
              dynamically produce comparatively more complex differentiations of
              any given phenomenal structure. I then show how Merleau-Ponty
              develops and specifies his interpretation of Schneider's
              intellectual difficulties in relation to the ambiguous role of the
              body, and in particular the hand, in Gerstmann's syndrome. I
              explain how Merleau-Ponty defends the idea that sensorimotor and
              quasi-representational cognition are mutually irreducible, while
              maintaining that symbol-based cognition is a fundamentally

              fall into familiar dichotomies such that one construes the

              states while characterizing the automatic motor processes that
              constitute motor skill execution as learned but fixed, invariant,
              bottom-up, brute-causal responses. In this essay, I will argue
              that this picture of skilled, automatic, motor processes is overly
              simplistic. Specifically, I will argue that an adequate account of
              the learned motor routines that constitute embodied skills cannot
              be given in a purely bottom-up, brute-causal fashion. Rather,
              motor control is intelligent all the way down. To establish this,
              I will first review two recent accounts of skill, Stanley and
              Krakauer (Front Hum Neurosci, 2013. doi:10.3389/fnhum.2013.0050)
              and Papineau (R Inst Philos Suppl 73:175--196, 2013), which
              characterize the automatic motor control responsible for the
              fine-grained movements constitutive of motor skill as brute,
              low-level phenomena. I will then isolate five key features that
              should apply to skilled motor control, if these accounts are
              correct. Together, the accounts posit that motor control is: (1)
              ballistic, (2) invariant, (3) independent of general action
              trajectories, (4) Insensitive to semantic content, and (5)
              independent of personal-level intentions. In the final section of
              this paper, I will appeal to optimal control theory for empirical
              evidence to challenge the commitment to skilled action as

              into dichotomous thinking about mental phenomena. On one side of
              the dichotomy there are processes that I will label
              ``unintelligent.'' These processes are thought to be unconscious,
              implicit, automatic, unintentional, involuntary, procedural, and
              non-cognitive. On the other side, there are ``intelligent''
              processes that are conscious, explicit, controlled, intentional,
              voluntary, declarative, and cognitive. Often, if a process or
              behavior is characterized by one of the features from either of
              the above lists, the process or behavior is classified as falling
              under the category to which the feature belongs. For example, if a
              process is implicit this is usually considered sufficient for
              classifying it as ``unintelligent'' and for assuming that the
              remaining features that fall under the ``unintelligent'' grouping
              will apply to it as well. Accordingly, if a process or behavior is
              automatic, philosophers often consider it to be unintelligent. It
              is my goal in this paper to challenge the conceptual slip from
              ``automatic'' to ``unintelligent''. I will argue that there are a
              whole range of properties highlighted by the existing
              psychological literature that make automaticity a much more
              complex phenomenon than is usually appreciated. I will then go on
              to discuss two further important relationships between automatic
              processes and controlled processes (C-processes) that arise when
              we think about automatic processes in the context of skilled
              behavior. These interactions should add to our resistance to
              classifying automaticity as unintelligent or mindless. In Sect. 1,
              I present a few representative cases of philosophers classifying
              automatic processes and behaviors as mindless or unintelligent. In
              Sect. 2, I review trends in the psychology of automaticity in
              order highlight a complex set of features that are characteristic,
              though not definitive, of automatic processes and behaviors. In
              Sect. 3, I argue that at least some automatic processes are likely
              cognitively penetrable. In Sect. 4, I argue that the structure of
              skilled automatic processes is shaped diachronically by practice,
              training and learning. Taken together, these considerations should

               in explaining the purposiveness of action? Standard accounts of
               action assign a role to intention but are silent on motor
               representation. The temptation is to suppose that nothing need be
               said here because motor representation is either only an enabling
               condition for purposive action or else merely a variety of
               intention. This paper provides reasons for resisting that
               temptation. Some motor representations, like intentions,
               coordinate actions in virtue of representing outcomes; but,
               unlike intentions, motor representations cannot feature as
               premises or conclusions in practical reasoning. This implies that
               motor representation has a distinctive role in explaining the
               purposiveness of action. It also gives rise to a problem: were
               the roles of intention and motor representation entirely
               independent, this would impair effective action. It is therefore
               necessary to explain how intentions interlock with motor
               representations. The solution, we argue, is to recognise that the
               contents of intentions can be partially determined by the

              to a diversity of laboratory phenomena that differ as to the
              preconditions necessary for their occurrence. Several major
              strains of automaticity are distinguished, based on the
              experimental conditions under which they are obtained:
              preconscious automatic processes, requiring only the proximal
              stimulus event; postconscious automatic processes, similar to
              preconscious effects but needing a recent activation or
              ``priming'' event for their operation; and goal-dependent
              automatic processes, which occur only when a specific, intentional
              processing goal is in place. It is argued that to more accurately
              specify the conditions under which an automatic effect will occur
              in the natural environment, greater attention needs to be given to
              aspects of the experimental paradigm (e.g., subjects' task goal,
              questionnaire administrations, previous tasks) that might be
              necessary to produce the effect.},

              agents---often fill us with awe with the way they perform their
              actions. One question we may ask ourselves is whether they
              intended to perform some awe-inspiring aspects of their actions.
              This question becomes all the more pressing as it often turns out
              that these agents were not conscious of some of those aspects at
              the time of performance. As I shall argue, there are reasons for
              suspecting lack of conscious access to an aspect of one's action
              to be incompatible with intending to perform that aspect of one's
              action. Subsequently, though, I will also argue that, in some
              cases, the incompatibility is only prima facie, and can be
              dispelled by drawing the following distinction: that between
              aspects of one's action that are merely temporarily not
              consciously accessed, versus aspects of one's action that are
              permanently inaccessible to consciousness. I will thus remove an
              obstacle towards saying that skilled agents intended to perform
              certain aspects of their actions, despite lack of conscious access
              to those aspects at the time of performance.},

               different in both experiments. Indeed, whereas in Experiment 1,

              that comprehenders sometimes reinterpret sentences to arrive at
              interpretations that conflict with the original language input.
              Does this reflect a reinterpretation of only the message, or also
              of earlier stages of linguistic representation such as the

              from handwriting to playing a musical instrument. Prior studies
              showed a fine-grained tuning of cortical primary motor, premotor,

              specification of individual movements to high-level sequence

              planning and execution. To address this, we trained 24 healthy
              right-handed human participants (14 females, 10 males) to produce
              four five-element finger press sequences with a particular finger
              order and timing structure in a delayed sequence production
              paradigm entirely from memory. Local cortical fMRI patterns during

              of trained timing, but not of order to new sequence feature
              combinations. Our findings suggest a general informational state
              shift from high-level feature separation to low-level feature
              integration within cortical regions for movement execution.
              Recompiling sequence features trial-by-trial during planning may
              enable flexible last-minute adjustment before movement
              initiation.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Musicians and athletes can
              modify the timing and order of movements in a sequence
              trial-by-trial, allowing for a vast repertoire of flexible
              behaviors. How does the brain put together these high-level
              sequence features into an integrated whole? We found that,
              trial-by-trial, the control of sequence features undergoes a state
              shift from separation during planning to integration during
              execution across a network of motor-related cortical areas. These
              findings have implications for understanding the hierarchical
              control of skilled movement sequences, as well as how information
              in brain areas unfolds across planning and execution.},

	abstract = {Sensorimotor adaptation is supported by at least two parallel
              learning systems: an intentionally controlled explicit strategy,
              and an involuntary implicit learning system. To investigate the
              error sources driving these two systems, past work focused on
              constrained reaches or finger movements in laboratory environments
              has shown subconscious learning systems to be driven in part by
              sensory prediction error (SPE), i.e., the mismatch between the
              realized and expected outcome of an action. We designed a ball
              rolling task to explore whether SPEs can drive implicit motor
              adaptation during complex whole-body movements that impart
              physical motion on external objects. After applying a visual
              shift, participants rapidly adapted their rolling angles to reduce
              the error between the ball and target. We removed all visual
              feedback and told participants to aim their throw directly toward
              the primary target, revealing an unintentional 5.06$\,^{\circ}$ implicit
              adjustment to reach angles that decayed over time. To determine
              whether this implicit adaptation was driven by SPE, we gave
              participants a second aiming target that would 'solve' the visual
              shift, as in Mazzoni and Krakauer (2006). Remarkably, after
              rapidly reducing ball rolling error to zero (due to enhancements
              in strategic aiming), the additional aiming target caused rolling
              angles to deviate beyond the primary target by 3.15$\,^{\circ}$. This
              involuntary overcompensation, which worsened task performance, is
              a hallmark of SPE-driven implicit learning. These results show
              that SPE-driven implicit processes, previously observed within
              simplified finger or planar reaching movements, actively
              contribute to motor adaptation in more complex naturalistic

              cognitive load imposed by a speech production task on the speech
              motor performance of healthy older and younger adults. Response
              inhibition, selective attention, and working memory were the
              primary cognitive processes of interest. Method Twelve healthy
              older and 12 healthy younger adults produced multiple repetitions
              of 4 sentences containing an embedded Stroop task in 2 cognitive
              load conditions: congruent and incongruent. The incongruent
              condition, which required participants to suppress orthographic
              information to say the font colors in which color words were
              written, represented an increase in cognitive load relative to the
              congruent condition in which word text and font color matched.
              Kinematic measures of articulatory coordination variability and
              movement duration as well as a behavioral measure of sentence
              production accuracy were compared between groups and conditions
              and across 3 sentence segments (pre-, during-, and post-Stroop).
              Results Increased cognitive load in the incongruent condition was
              associated with increased articulatory coordination variability
              and movement duration, compared to the congruent Stroop condition,
              for both age groups. Overall, the effect of increased cognitive
              load was greater for older adults than younger adults and was
              greatest in the portion of the sentence in which cognitive load
              was manipulated (during-Stroop), followed by the pre-Stroop
              segment. Sentence production accuracy was reduced for older adults
              in the incongruent condition. Conclusions Increased cognitive load
              involving response inhibition, selective attention, and working

              the stability and timing with which speech was produced by both

              hierarchy of processing units, mirroring the roughly hierarchical
              structure of naturalistic tasks themselves. The present study
              considers an alternative framework, in which the representation of

              (e.g., ``cuff of coffee''). These errors reveal the extent to

              piggybacking on domain-general sequence learning abilities.
              Evidence from genetics, comparative work on non-human primates,

              circumstances. For instance, the promise of a reward leads to
              faster movements. Reward also leads us to move with a lower
              reaction time, suggesting that the process of action selection can
              also be invigorated by reward. It has been proposed that
              invigoration of action selection and of action execution might
              occur through a common mechanism, and thus these aspects of
              behavior might be coupled. To test this hypothesis, we asked
              participants to make reaching movements to ``shoot'' through a
              target at varying speeds to assess whether moving more quickly was

              and motor tasks, but less is known about their relation to
              mentally simulated movements (known as motor imagery). Previous
              work found pupil dilations during the execution of simple finger
              movements, where peak pupillary dilation scaled with the
              complexity of the finger movement and force required. Recently,
              pupillary dilations were reported during imagery of grasping and
              piano playing. Here, we examined whether pupillary responses are
              sensitive to the dynamics of the underlying motor task for both
              executed and imagined reach movements. Participants reached or
              imagined reaching to one of three targets placed at different
              distances from a start position. Both executed and imagined
              movement times scaled with target distance, and they were highly
              correlated, confirming previous work and suggesting that
              participants did imagine the respective movement. Increased
              pupillary dilation was evident during motor execution compared
              with rest, with stronger dilations for larger movements. Pupil
              dilations also occurred during motor imagery, however, they were
              generally weaker than those during motor execution and they were
              not influenced by imagined movement distance. Instead, dilations
              during motor imagery resembled pupil responses obtained during a
              nonmotor imagery task (imagining a previously viewed painting).
              Our results demonstrate that pupillary responses can reliably
              capture the dynamics of an executed goal-directed reaching
              movement, but suggest that pupillary responses during imagined

              but also during mental simulation of goal-directed reaching
              movements. However, pupil dilations scale with movement amplitude

              leftward (spatially compatible with a left response/``yellow''
              report), the threshold for a ``yellow'' perceptuomotor decision
              was reduced-consistent with the hypothesis that increasing

              reporting bias. Further, when stimuli appeared rightward

              threshold for a ``blue'' perceptuomotor decision was reduced. An
              additional experiment revealed that directional saccades occurring
              during the task were unlikely to account for biases. Overall,
              spatially induced response activation influenced the decision
              outcomes, providing support for a tightly coupled
              perception-action system underlying perceptuomotor decisions.

	abstract = {The duration of action can be critical to accomplishing specific
              goals. Empirical findings and theoretical considerations suggest
              that different stages of action planning and execution require
              different specification levels of action features. It is assumed
              that at first only crude categorical features are integrated into
              action plans, which are then specified by subsequent sensorimotor
              processes during action execution based on situational conditions.
              In two experiments, we investigated if the integration of action
              duration into action plans indeed relies exclusively on
              categorical duration representations or also on continuous-metric
              representations. Participants responded to visual prime and probe
              stimuli with short and long key presses. The duration of the prime
              response was indicated by a previous response cue, and the
              duration of the probe response was indicated by the shape of the
              probe stimulus. Analyses of response durations revealed that for
              response category repetitions from prime to probe, the actual
              durations of the repeated responses were more similar for shape
              repetitions than for shape switches. This indicates that
              continuous temporal information is integrated into an action plan
              and subsequently retrieved by stimulus repetition. Our results
              suggest that action duration is integrated into the action plan in
              a relatively precise form at an early stage of action planning.

               distinctive species focus on evolution. This book proposes a
               theoretical framework for organizing and explaining the research
               that author and his colleagues did from 1998 to 2017 in the
               Department of Developmental and Comparative Psychology of the Max
               Planck Institute of Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig,
               Germany. It proposes a complementary theory of human uniqueness,
               focused on development. Building on the seminal ideas of
               Vygotsky, the data-driven model explains how those things that
               make us most human are constructed during the first years of a
               child's life. The book assembles nearly three decades of
               experimental work with chimpanzees, bonobos, and human children
               to propose a new framework for psychological growth between birth
               and seven years of age. It identifies eight pathways that starkly
               differentiate humans from their closest primate relatives: social
               cognition, communication, cultural learning, cooperative
               thinking, collaboration, prosociality, social norms, and moral
               identity. In each of these, great apes possess rudimentary
               abilities. But because humans have evolved capacities for shared
               intentionality, the book argues, these abilities are
               transformed---through the new forms of sociocultural interaction
               they enable---into uniquely human cognition and sociality. The
               first step occurs around nine months, with the emergence of joint
               intentionality, exercised mostly with caregiving adults. The
               second step occurs around three years, with the emergence of
               collective intentionality involving both authoritative adults,
               who convey cultural knowledge, and coequal peers, who elicit
               collaboration and communication. Finally, by age six or seven,
               children become responsible for self-regulating their beliefs and
               actions so that they comport with cultural norms. The book places
               human sociocultural activity within the framework of modern
               evolutionary theory, and shows how biology creates the conditions
               under which culture does its work. (PsycINFO Database Record (c)

               possibility of noise in the input, e.g., from speaker error,
               listener mishearing, or environmental noise. Consequently,
               semantically implausible sentences such as The girl tossed the
               apple the boy are often interpreted as a semantically plausible
               alternative (e.g., The girl tossed the apple to the boy).
               Previous investigations of noisy-channel comprehension have
               relied exclusively on paradigms with isolated sentences. Because
               supportive contexts alter the expectations of possible
               interpretations, the noisy channel framework predicts that
               context should encourage more inference in interpreting
               implausible sentences, relative to null contexts (i.e. a lack of
               context) or unsupportive contexts. In the present work, we tested

               implausible sentences more than non-supportive contexts or null
               contexts. These results suggest that noisy-channel inference may

	abstract = {Agrammatism is a disorder of language production characterized by
              short, simplified sentences, the omission of function words, an
              increased use of nouns over verbs and a higher use of heavy verbs.
              Despite observing these phenomena for decades, the accounts of
              agrammatism have not converged. Here, we propose and test the
              hypothesis that the lexical profile of agrammatism results from a
              process that opts for words with a lower frequency of occurrence
              to increase lexical information. Furthermore, we hypothesize that
              this process is a compensatory response to patients' core deficit
              in producing long, complex sentences. In this cross-sectional
              study, we analysed speech samples of patients with primary
              progressive aphasia (n = 100) and healthy speakers (n = 65) as
              they described a picture. The patient cohort included 34
              individuals with the non-fluent variant, 41 with the logopenic
              variant and 25 with the semantic variant of primary progressive
              aphasia. We first analysed a large corpus of spoken language and
              found that the word types preferred by patients with agrammatism
              tend to have lower frequencies of occurrence than less preferred
              words. We then conducted a computational simulation to examine the
              impact of word frequency on lexical information as measured by
              entropy. We found that strings of words that exclude highly
              frequent words have a more uniform word distribution, thereby
              increasing lexical entropy. To test whether the lexical profile of
              agrammatism results from their inability to produce long
              sentences, we asked healthy speakers to produce short sentences
              during the picture description task. We found that, under this
              constrained condition, a similar lexical profile of agrammatism
              emerged in the short sentences of healthy individuals, including
              fewer function words, more nouns than verbs and more heavy verbs
              than light verbs. This lexical profile of short sentences resulted
              in their lower average word frequency than unconstrained
              sentences. We extended this finding by showing that, in general,
              shorter sentences get packaged with lower-frequency words as a
              basic property of efficient language production, evident in the
              language of healthy speakers and all primary progressive aphasia

              such metacognitive monitoring are well documented, but what
              determines an individual's monitoring accuracy in a particular
              context is yet to be fully understood. One candidate contributor
              to monitoring accuracy is working memory. In this study, we
              investigated whether and how working memory contributes to the
              accuracy of monitoring processes. Most evidence for a positive
              relationship between working memory and monitoring accuracy has
              been provided by correlational studies. Here, an experimental
              approach was applied in which confidence judgments were collected
              after each memory recall in three working memory experiments, and
              the effect of increasing the working memory demands on monitoring
              accuracy was examined. A visuospatial complex span task, a verbal
              complex span task, and an updating task served as the working
              memory tasks, to cover the range of methods used in working memory
              research. Confirmatory analyses conducted using cumulative link
              mixed models indicated that in two out of three experiments,
              monitoring accuracy suffered when working memory demands
              increased. As such, the weight of evidence supports a dependent

              whereby monitoring accuracy can fluctuate during a task depending
              on the available cognitive resources. This indicates that the

              inhibition of another action, this typically results in frequent
              false-positive executions of the latter (inhibition failures). The
              absence of inhibitory demands in dual-action trials can render
              performance less error-prone (and sometimes faster) than in
              single-action trials. In the present study, we investigated the
              temporal dynamics of inhibitory control difficulties by varying
              the preparation time (for simultaneous action execution and
              inhibition). In two experiments, participants responded to a
              single peripheral visual target either with an eye movement toward
              it (Single Saccade), with a spatially corresponding button press
              (Single Manual), or with both responses simultaneously (Dual
              Action) as indicated by a color cue. Preparation time was
              manipulated via the cue-stimulus interval within blocks
              (Experiment 1) and between blocks (Experiment 2). Overall,
              responses were faster with longer (vs. shorter) preparation time.
              Crucially, however, our results reveal the exact dynamics of how
              inhibition failures (and thus dual-action benefits) in both
              response modalities substantially decrease with longer
              preparation, even though the cue did not contain information
              regarding the fully specified response that needed to be inhibited
              (i.e., its direction). These results highlight the role of
              sufficient preparation time not only for efficient action
              execution but also for concurrent inhibitory performance. The

              have merely to press a large or small switch (we removed the

              were faster when the syllable KA was read compared with TI and

              restricted to grasping responses, and, in addition, it supports an

              studies show that two memory systems in the brain are involved in

              late-developing cognitive or declarative memory system. We argue
              that higher cognitive development constrains implicit statistical
              learning processes that are essential for learning patterns and
              regularities in languages, that is, the adult cognitive
              architecture has a cost. This is supported by experimental
              evidence showing that acquisition of implicit linguistic knowledge

              development during the preschool years, such that children with
              good executive functions also have larger vocabularies. However,
              why this is the case remains to be discovered. In this study, we
              focused on the hypothesis that sentence processing abilities
              mediate the association between EF skills and receptive vocabulary
              knowledge, in that the speed of language acquisition is at least
              partially dependent on a child's processing ability, which is
              itself dependent on executive control. We tested this hypothesis
              in longitudinal data from a cohort of 3- and 4-year-old children
              at three age points (37, 43, and 49 months). We found evidence,

              measured by the Backward Digit Span], and inhibition) and
              receptive vocabulary knowledge across this age range. However,

              their message. To date, much of the research on utterance planning
              has focused on situations in which the speaker knows the full
              message to convey. Less is known about circumstances in which
              speakers begin utterance planning before they are certain about
              their message. In three picture-naming experiments, we used a
              novel paradigm to examine how speakers plan utterances before a
              full message is known. In Experiments 1 and 2, participants viewed
              displays showing two pairs of objects, followed by a cue to name
              one pair. In an Overlap condition, one object appeared in both
              pairs, providing early information about one of the objects to
              name. In a Different condition, there was no object overlap.
              Across both spoken and typed responses, participants tended to
              name the overlapping target first in the Overlap condition, with
              shorter initiation latencies compared with other utterances.
              Experiment 3 used a semantically constraining question to provide
              early information about the upcoming targets, and participants
              tended to name the more likely target first in their response.
              These results suggest that in situations of uncertainty, producers
              choose word orders that allow them to begin early planning.
              Producers prioritize message components that are certain to be

              and brain. However, little is known about the large-scale
              intrinsic cortical network changes that occur during childhood
              because of methodological challenges in scanning young children.
              Here, we overcome this barrier by using sophisticated acquisition
              and analysis tools to investigate functional network development
              in children between the ages of 4 and 10 years ([Formula: see
              text]; 50 female, 42 male). At multiple spatial scales, age is
              positively associated with brain network segregation. At the
              system level, age was associated with segregation of systems
              involved in attention from those involved in abstract cognition,
              and with integration among attentional and perceptual systems.
              Associations between age and functional connectivity are most
              pronounced in visual and medial prefrontal cortex, the two ends of
              a gradient from perceptual, externally oriented cortex to
              abstract, internally oriented cortex. These findings suggest that
              both ends of the sensory-association gradient may develop early,
              in contrast to the classical theories that cortical maturation
              proceeds from back to front, with sensory areas developing first
              and association areas developing last. More mature patterns of
              brain network architecture, controlling for age, were associated
              with better visuospatial reasoning abilities. Our results suggest
              that as cortical architecture becomes more specialized, children
              become more able to reason about the world and their place in
              it.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Anthropologists have called the
              transition from early to middle childhood the ``age of reason'',
              when children across cultures become more independent. We employ
              cutting-edge neuroimaging acquisition and analysis approaches to
              investigate associations between age and functional brain
              architecture in childhood. Age was positively associated with
              segregation between cortical systems that process the external
              world and those that process abstract phenomena like the past,
              future, and minds of others. Surprisingly, we observed pronounced
              development at both ends of the sensory-association gradient,
              challenging the theory that sensory areas develop first and
              association areas develop last. Our results open new directions

              benefits of collecting functional connectivity data while
              participants are exposed to naturalistic stimuli, such as watching
              a movie or listening to a story. For example, functional
              connectivity data collected during movie-watching were shown to
              predict cognitive and emotional scores more accurately than
              resting-state-derived functional connectivity. We have previously
              reported a tight link between resting-state functional
              connectivity and task-derived neural activity, such that the

               production in monolog is comparatively slow. Theories of dialog
               tend to agree that interlocutors manage these timing demands by
               planning a response early, before the current speaker reaches the
               end of their turn. In the first half of this chapter, I review

               research also suggests that planning a response early, while

               disposal, including dialectal and register variants, that they
               may deploy in the appropriate social context. This linguistic
               flexibility must be supported by processes that allow speakers to

               Despite the ubiquitousness of these different repertoires in

               this article, we provide an overview of the extant literature and

               common use among bilinguals, understanding the production and
               comprehension of codeswitching presents unique challenges to
               current theories of sentence processing. We overview the
               planning, production, and comprehension of codeswitching,
               discussing the complex interaction between linguistic, cognitive,
               and social factors that modulate its use and its comprehension.
               This overview brings to the forefront an apparent paradox between
               measurable processing costs and the ease with which bilinguals
               engage in codeswitching, namely, that codeswitching introduces
               greater ambiguity into the linguistic signal yet does not lead to
               disruptive processing delays. To account for this contradiction,
               we propose the Adaptive Predictability hypothesis with two
               premises: bilinguals adapt predictive cues in sentence processing
               as a consequence of exposure to distributional regularities in
               production, and they recruit greater cognitive control in the
               service of rapidly integrating codeswitches in real time. We end
               the chapter by illustrating recent findings that support the
               Adaptive Predictability hypothesis and areas for future
               directions.},

               the literature surrounding verb biases, or cases where a verb
               that can occur with multiple sentence structures is most likely
               to occur with only one. Findings in comprehension and production
               suggest that many kinds of language users rely on verb biases.
               Verb biases are acquired through distributional learning, which
               explains the ability to learn complex statistical relationships
               throughout the lifespan. This learning shares similarities with
               associative learning, which is highlighted by recent empirical

              modalities of language production. Here, the issue of serial order
              was investigated with respect to typewriting. Following seminal
              investigations in the spoken modality, we conducted an experiment
              where participants typed as many times as possible a pair of words
              during a fixed time-window. The 2 words shared either their first
              2 keystrokes, the last 2 ones, all the keystrokes, or were
              unrelated. Fine-grained performance measures were recorded at the
              level of individual keystrokes. In contrast with previous results
              from the spoken modality, we observed an overall facilitation for
              words sharing the initial keystrokes. In addition, the initial
              overlap briefly delayed the execution of the following keystroke.
              The results are discussed with reference to different theoretical
              perspectives on serial order, with a particular attention to the
              competing accounts offered by position coding models and chaining
              models. Our findings point to potential major differences between

              for the action domain, we developed an analogous key-pressing
              task, ``finger fumblers.'' Our results show that both language and

              was recently argued by Andr{\'e} (2022) that if outliers are instead

               what to say---that is, before they know what message they want to

               for these situations, and researchers typically assume that
               language production begins with a pre-determined message. Given
               the relative lack of research on production under message
               uncertainty, here I gather evidence from several neighboring
               areas to introduce issues of message uncertainty and motivate
               future research. The arguments raised will point to how and why
               message uncertainty should be incorporated into language
               production research: First, message uncertainty might be more
               common than assumed, and language production research would
               benefit from identifying the incidence and types of message
               uncertainty. Second, situations of message uncertainty carry
               implications for utterance forms and the time course of
               production, given a highly flexible production system that uses
               different strategies to mitigate difficulties of planning under
               uncertainty. Third, uncertainty is ubiquitous in other cognitive
               domains, and in particular uncertainty in the motor domain, such
               as beginning an action sequence before the goal is determined,
               shows many parallels with uncertainty in language. These parallel
               lines of research could inform and benefit each other,
               contributing to our understanding of which domain-general
               cognitive principles are used for planning and acting when there
               is only partial information about the goal. Finally,
               investigating situations of message uncertainty would not only
               address a common everyday context of production, but could also
               inform theories of language production and cognition more

               the stimulus characteristics, probability and associated reward.
               However, in many cases, the motor response is considered to be a
               neutral output channel that only reflects the upstream decision.
               Contrary to this view, we show that perceptual decisions can be
               recursively influenced by the physical resistance applied to the
               response. When participants reported the direction of the visual
               motion by left or right manual reaching movement with different

               associated with less effortful option. Repeated exposure to such

               inference of choice priors in situations of referential
               ambiguity. In particular, we use the scenario of signaling games
               and investigate to which extent study participants profit from
               actively engaging in the task. Previous work has revealed that
               speakers are able to infer listeners' choice priors upon
               observing ambiguity resolution. However, it was also shown that
               only a small group of participants was able to strategically
               construct ambiguous situations to create learning opportunities.
               This paper sets to address how prior inference unfolds in more
               complex learning scenarios. In Experiment 1, we examine whether
               participants accumulate evidence about inferred choice priors
               across a series of four consecutive trials. Despite the intuitive
               simplicity of the task, information integration turns out to be
               only partially successful. Integration errors result from a
               variety of sources, including transitivity failure and recency
               bias. In Experiment 2, we investigate how the ability to actively
               construct learning scenarios affects the success of prior
               inference and whether the iterative settings improve the ability
               to choose utterances strategically. The results suggest that full

              message and linguistic encoding of this information. The
              transition from thought to speech occurs incrementally, with
              cascading planning at subsequent levels of production. In this
              article, we aim to specify the mechanisms that support incremental
              message preparation. We contrast two hypotheses about the
              mechanisms responsible for incorporating message-level information
              into a linguistic plan. According to the Initial Preparation view,
              messages can be encoded as fluent utterances if all information is
              ready before speaking begins. By contrast, on the Continuous
              Incrementality view, messages can be continually prepared and
              updated throughout the production process, allowing for fluent
              production even if new information is added to the message while
              speaking is underway. Testing these hypotheses, eye-tracked
              speakers in two experiments produced unscripted, conjoined noun
              phrases with modifiers. Both experiments showed that new message
              elements can be incrementally incorporated into the utterance even
              after articulation begins, consistent with a Continuous
              Incrementality view of message planning, in which messages
              percolate to linguistic encoding immediately as that information
              becomes available in the mind of the speaker. We conclude by
              discussing the functional role of incremental message planning in
              conversational speech and the situations in which this continuous
              incremental planning would be most likely to be observed.},

               application of independently motivated principles of memory and
               cognitive skill to the specialized task of sentence parsing. The
               resulting theory construes sentence processing as a series of
               skilled associative memory retrievals modulated by
               similarity-based interference and fluctuating activation. The
               cognitive principles are formalized in computational form in the

               accounts of the effects of length and structural interference on

               between possible sources of this variability provides a way to
               discriminate between production accounts that assume structurally
               incremental and lexically incremental sentence planning. Two
               picture-naming experiments evaluated changes in speakers'
               planning scope as a function of experience with message
               structure, sentence structure, and lexical items. On target
               trials participants produced sentences beginning with two
               semantically related or unrelated objects in the same complex
               noun phrase. To manipulate familiarity with sentence structure,
               target displays were preceded by prime displays that elicited the

               lexical retrieval, target sentences began either with the

               The results show that repetition of sentence structure can extend

               found within subtle variations in how we pronounce sounds. While
               speech errors have traditionally been seen as categorical
               substitutions of one sound for another, acoustic/articulatory
               analyses show they partially reflect the intended sound. When
               ``pig'' is mispronounced as ``big,'' the resulting /b/ sound
               differs from correct productions of ``big,'' moving towards
               intended ``pig''-revealing the role of graded sound
               representations in speech production. Investigating the origins
               of such phenomena requires detailed estimation of speech sound
               distributions; this has been hampered by reliance on subjective,
               labor-intensive manual annotation. Computational methods can
               address these issues by providing for objective, automatic
               measurements. We develop a novel high-precision computational
               approach, based on a set of machine learning algorithms, for
               measurement of elicited speech. The algorithms are trained on
               existing manually labeled data to detect and locate
               linguistically relevant acoustic properties with high accuracy.
               Our approach is robust, is designed to handle mis-productions,
               and overall matches the performance of expert coders. It allows
               us to analyze a very large dataset of speech errors (containing
               far more errors than the total in the existing literature),
               illuminating properties of speech sound distributions previously
               impossible to reliably observe. We argue that this provides novel
               evidence that two sources both contribute to deviations in speech
               errors: planning processes specifying the targets of articulation
               and articulatory processes specifying the motor movements that
               execute this plan. These findings illustrate how a much richer

               Many studies have used experimental paradigms targeting the
               production of subject-verb agreement from a sentence preamble
               (The key to the cabinets) and eliciting verb errors ({\ldots} *were
               shiny). Through reanalysis of previous data (50 experiments;
               102,369 observations), we show that this paradigm also results in
               many errors in preamble repetition, particularly of local noun
               number (The key to the *cabinet). We explore the mechanisms of
               both errors in parallelism in producing syntax (PIPS), a model in
               the Gradient Symbolic Computation framework. PIPS models sentence
               production using a continuous-state stochastic dynamical system
               that optimizes grammatical constraints (shaped by previous
               experience) over vector representations of symbolic structures.
               At intermediate stages in the computation, grammatical
               constraints allow multiple competing parses to be partially
               activated, resulting in stable but transient conjunctive blend
               states. In the context of the preamble completion task, memory
               constraints reduce the strength of the target structure, allowing
               for co-activation of non-target parses where the local noun
               controls the verb (notional agreement and locally agreeing
               relative clauses) and non-target parses that include structural
               constituents with contrasting number specifications (e.g., plural
               instead of singular local noun). Simulations of the preamble

              tested the assumption that individuals make use of a general
              metacognitive evaluation of task demand during selections. A DST
              was utilized in a forced-choice paradigm that required individuals
              to either select the most effortful, time demanding, or least
              accurate of 2 choices. Patterns of selections were similar across
              all rating dimensions, lending credit to this notion. Findings are
              discussed within a metacognitive framework of demand avoidance and
              contrasted to current theories. (PsycINFO Database Record},

              information is prioritized according to the task determining where
              and when to attend, look, and act. In well-practiced sequential
              actions, long-term memory (LTM)-based expectations specify which
              action targets might be found where and when. We have previously
              demonstrated (Foerster and Schneider, 2015b) that violations of
              such expectations that are task-relevant (e.g., target location
              change) cause a regression from a memory-based mode of attentional
              selection to visual search. How might task-irrelevant expectation
              violations in such well-practiced sequential manual actions modify
              attentional selection? This question was investigated by a
              computerized version of the number-connection test. Participants
              clicked on nine spatially distributed numbered target circles in
              ascending order while eye movements were recorded as proxy for
              covert attention. Target's visual features and locations stayed
              constant for 65 prechange-trials, allowing practicing the manual
              action sequence. Consecutively, a task-irrelevant expectation
              violation occurred and stayed for 20 change-trials. Specifically,
              action target number 4 appeared in a different font. In 15
              reversion-trials, number 4 returned to the original font. During
              the first task-irrelevant change trial, manual clicking was slower
              and eye scanpaths were larger and contained more fixations. The
              additional fixations were mainly checking fixations on the changed
              target while acting on later targets. Whereas the eyes repeatedly
              revisited the task-irrelevant change, cursor-paths remained
              completely unaffected. Effects lasted for 2-3 change trials and
              did not reappear during reversion. In conclusion, an unexpected
              task-irrelevant change on a task-defining feature of a
              well-practiced manual sequence leads to eye-hand decoupling and a

              accounts of DLL, we propose that it is an extended mind strategy

              between-subjects experiment in which participants had to
              categorize two pairs of highly confusable dog breeds after
              receiving categorization training on just one pair of breeds. In
              the treatment group, participants were grouped in dyads and were
              allowed to interact with each other by means of the labels of
              these four dog breeds. In their queries to trained 'experts',
              novices frequently used labels to refer to breeds that they could
              not identify themselves. Experts were highly responsive to their
              paired novices' queries, and the rates of querying for the two
              members within a dyad were positively correlated. Independent
              categorization failure and offloading categorization success lead
              to subsequent increases in querying by novices, indicating
              adaptive use of offloading. Self-reports of breed knowledge were
              higher for experts within a dyad compared to isolated experts.

              Inside a speaker's brain, an intended message gives rise to neural
              signals activating the muscles of the vocal tract. The process is
              remarkable because these muscles are activated in just the right
              way that the vocal tract produces sounds a listener understands as
              the intended message. What is the best approach to understanding
              the neural substrate of this crucial motor control process? One of
              the key recent modeling developments in neuroscience has been the
              use of state feedback control (SFC) theory to explain the role of
              the CNS in motor control. SFC postulates that the CNS controls
              motor output by (1) estimating the current dynamic state of the
              thing (e.g., arm) being controlled, and (2) generating controls
              based on this estimated state. SFC has successfully predicted a
              great range of non-speech motor phenomena, but as yet has not
              received attention in the speech motor control community. Here, we
              review some of the key characteristics of speech motor control and
              what they say about the role of the CNS in the process. We then
              discuss prior efforts to model the role of CNS in speech motor
              control, and argue that these models have inherent limitations -
              limitations that are overcome by an SFC model of speech motor
              control which we describe. We conclude by discussing a plausible

              over the environmental state, and motor control signals try to
              fulfill the corresponding sensory predictions. We propose that the

              flexible intentions-or motor plans from a belief over targets-to
              dynamically generate goal-directed actions, and we develop a

              English allows infinite embedding of the prenominal genitive -s,

              do speakers learn which specific structures allow infinite

              suggests that the recursion of a structure (e.g., X1's-X2) is

              the articulatory plans that guide speech in each language remains
              unclear. Here, we directly address this question in bilingual
              speakers. We use a sensorimotor adaptation paradigm to drive the
              acquisition of novel articulatory plans for speech in one language
              and then measure the extent to which these new motor plans
              influence articulatory plans in the speaker's other language.
              Twenty L1-French, L2-English bilinguals adapted their speech
              production to a real-time alteration of vowel sounds. In one
              session, the adaptation was acquired during French sentence
              production; in a second session, the adaptation was acquired
              during English sentence production. In each session,
              cross-language transfer of these novel articulatory plans for
              speech was assessed using a transfer task that involved the
              production of French and English words with heavily noise-masked
              auditory feedback. Sensorimotor adaptation that countered the
              vowel sound alteration was observed in both French and English.
              Regardless of the linguistic context in which the adaptation was
              acquired, the adaptation transferred to the production of words in
              both languages. The amount of transfer did not depend on whether
              the adaptation was acquired in the participant's L1 or L2. In a

              unit activity using a high-density surface EMG signal from the
              anterior deltoid muscle to test whether heterogeneity in motor
              units could reveal early preparatory activity. Consistent with our
              previous work (Rungta et al., 2021), we observed early selective
              recruitment of small-amplitude size motor units during the delay
              period for hand movements like early recruitment of
              small-amplitude motor units in neck muscles of non-human primates
              performing delayed saccade tasks. This early activity was
              spatially specific and increased with time and resembled an
              accumulation to threshold model that correlated with movement
              onset time. Such early recruitment of ramping motor units was
              observed at the single trial level as well. In contrast, no such
              recruitment of large amplitude size motor units, called
              non-rampers, was observed during the delay period. Instead,
              non-rampers became spatially specific and predicted movement onset
              time after the delay period. Interestingly, spatially specific
              delay period activity was only observed for hand movements but was

              muscle activity was correlated with the time it took to initiate

              the sustained effect of auditory entrainment and the interaction
              between temporal complexity and pitch on predefined sequential
              tapping with tapping sequences predefined before a
              synchronization-timekeeping task. Temporal complexity was
              manipulated by increasing the number of non-integer ratios in
              temporal rhythm. The rhythm sequences were presented with either
              multiple pitches or a single pitch. We found a reduction in mean
              asynchronies and ratio error in three rhythms with non-integer
              ratios, while inter-response interval error was reduced in the
              integer rhythm and the rhythm with one repetitive integer ratio
              and one non-integer ratio. Ratio error remanence was less in
              rhythms with two non-integer ratios. We found no significant
              difference between the two pitch types. There was a sustained
              entrainment effect of sequential tapping that varied with
              differing temporal complexity, and pitch information was not
              essential for auditory entrainment. These findings provide support

              that individuals with semantic, but not phonological, working
              memory (WM) deficits have difficulty producing phrases containing
              several content words. These findings supported the claim of a
              phrasal scope of planning at the grammatical formulation stage of
              production, where semantic WM supports the maintenance of
              lexical-semantic representations as they are inserted into slots
              in phrasal constituents. Recent narrative production results for
              individuals at the acute stage of stroke supported the role for
              semantic WM in phrasal elaboration while suggesting a role for
              phonological WM at a subsequent phonological encoding stage in
              supporting fluent, rapid speech. In the present study, we employed
              a larger participant sample while controlling for single word
              production abilities at semantic and phonological levels. Results
              confirmed the relations between semantic WM and phrasal
              elaboration whereas the relation between phonological WM and
              speech rate was eliminated. There was, however, evidence that both
              impaired phonological retrieval and restricted phonological WM
              were related to the tendency to produce short, highly frequent
              words such as pronouns rather than longer, less frequent words.
              Future research is needed to address whether the results relating
              to phonological WM depend on damage specific to an output rather

              competitors but minimized lexical access (probe task) or required
              extra-lexical mechanisms of control (Stroop task). In continuous

              speech fluency can therefore help characterize the robustness of
              these systems over the life span. Older adults have been assumed
              to be more disfluent, but current evidence is minimal and
              contradictory. Particularly noteworthy is the lack of longitudinal
              data that would help establish whether a given individual's
              disfluency rates change over time. This study examines changes in
              disfluency rates through a sequential design with a longitudinal
              component, involving the analysis of 325 recorded interviews
              conducted with 91 individuals at several points in their lives,
              spanning the ages of 20-94 years. We analyzed the speech of these
              individuals to assess the extent to which they became more
              disfluent in later interviews. We found that, with older age,
              individuals spoke more slowly and repeated more words. However,
              older age was not associated with other types of disfluencies such
              as filled pauses (uh's and um's) and repairs. Overall, this study
              provides evidence that, although age itself is not a strong
              predictor of disfluencies, age leads to changes in other speech
              characteristics among some individuals (i.e., speech rate and
              indicators of lexical and syntactic complexity), and those changes
              in turn predict the production of disfluencies over the life span.

              exposed to them. In this study, we examined a factor not
              considered in prior work: people's evaluations of the strategies
              themselves. We presented undergraduate participants from a
              moderately selective university (N = 252; 64.8\% women, 65.6\%
              White, 67.6\% who had taken calculus) with two strategies for
              solving algebraic word problems and asked them to rate these
              strategies and their own strategy on a variety of dimensions.
              Participants' ratings loaded onto two factors, which we label
              quality and difficulty. Participants' initial evaluations of the
              quality of the strategies were associated with whether they used
              the strategies at posttest, and this effect held even when

               phrase structure to word strings in two steps. The first stage
               parser assigns lexical and phrasal nodes to substrings of roughly
               six words. The second stage parser then adds higher nodes to link
               these phrasal packages together into a complete phrase

               with the two-stage models of Kimball (1973) and Fodor, Bever and
               Garrett (1974). Our assumption that the units which are shunted
               from the first stage to the second stage are defined by their
               length, rather than by their syntactic type, explains the effects
               of constituent length on perceptual complexity in center embedded
               sentences and in sentences of the kind that fall under Kimball's

               appeal to any ad hoc parsing strategies, why the parser makes
               certain `shortsighted' errors even though, in general, it is able

               is externally triggered, the electromyographic (EMG) responses
               are synchronized, resulting in the hand displacement preceding
               the foot. Under predictive control, where the movement is
               self-paced, the motor commands are organized such that the
               displacement onset occurs relatively synchronously, requiring the
               EMG onset of the foot to precede that of the hand. The current
               study used a startling acoustic stimulus (SAS), which can
               involuntarily trigger a prepared response, to investigate whether
               these results are due to differences in a pre-programmed timing
               structure of the responses. Participants performed synchronous
               movements of the right heel and right hand under both reactive

               a simple reaction time (RT) task, whereas the predictive
               condition involved an anticipation-timing task. On selected
               trials, a SAS (114 dB) was presented 150 ms prior to the

               modes, is pre-programmed; however, under predictive control, the
               SAS may accelerate the internal timekeeper, resulting in a

               for both animals and mobile robots, or animats, need reactive
               mechanisms for exploration, and learned plans to reach goal
               objects once an environment becomes familiar. The SOVEREIGN
               (Self-Organizing, Vision, Expectation, Recognition, Emotion,
               Intelligent, Goal-oriented Navigation) animat model embodies
               these capabilities, and is tested in a 3D virtual reality
               environment. SOVEREIGN includes several interacting subsystems
               which model complementary properties of cortical What and Where
               processing streams and which clarify similarities between
               mechanisms for navigation and arm movement control. As the animat
               explores an environment, visual inputs are processed by networks
               that are sensitive to visual form and motion in the What and
               Where streams, respectively. Position-invariant and
               size-invariant recognition categories are learned by real-time
               incremental learning in the What stream. Estimates of target
               position relative to the animat are computed in the Where stream,
               and can activate approach movements toward the target. Motion
               cues from animat locomotion can elicit head-orienting movements
               to bring a new target into view. Approach and orienting movements
               are alternately performed during animat navigation. Cumulative
               estimates of each movement are derived from interacting
               proprioceptive and visual cues. Movement sequences are stored
               within a motor working memory. Sequences of visual categories are
               stored in a sensory working memory. These working memories
               trigger learning of sensory and motor sequence categories, or
               plans, which together control planned movements. Predictively
               effective chunk combinations are selectively enhanced via
               reinforcement learning when the animat is rewarded. Selected
               planning chunks effect a gradual transition from variable
               reactive exploratory movements to efficient goal-oriented planned
               movement sequences. Volitional signals gate interactions between
               model subsystems and the release of overt behaviors. The model
               can control different motor sequences under different
               motivational states and learns more efficient sequences to
               rewarded goals as exploration proceeds.},

               on rules. When there is uncertainty about the rule that applies
               for a given cue, planning a movement involves both choosing the

               specific target from a number of alternatives. Recent studies
               show that before reaching, multiple potential reach targets are
               encoded in brain regions involved in action control and that,
               when people are required to initiate the reach before the target
               is specified, initial hand direction is biased by the spatial
               distribution of potential targets. These findings have led to the
               suggestion that the brain, during planning, simultaneously
               prepares multiple reaches to potential targets. In addition to
               hand direction, reach planning often involves specifying other
               parameters such as wrist orientation. For example, when posting a
               letter in a mail slot, both the location and orientation of the
               slot must be encoded to control hand direction and orientation.
               Therefore, if the brain prepares multiple reaches to potential
               targets and if these targets require the specification of hand
               direction and orientation, then both of these variables should be
               biased by the spatial distribution of potential targets. To test
               this prediction, we examined a task in which participants moved a
               hand-held rectangular tool toward multiple rectangular targets of
               varying location and orientation, one of which was selected, with
               equal probability as the actual target after movement initiation.
               We found that initial hand direction and orientation were biased
               by the spatial distributions of potential target locations and
               orientations, respectively. This result is consistent with the
               idea that the brain, in cases of target uncertainty,

               decision-making and movement patterns according to time
               constraints. Here, we examined how sensorimotor strategies are
               selected under time constraints when the target values are
               uncertain. In the double-target condition, the values were
               uncertain until the movement onset and presented immediately
               afterwards. The behavior in this condition was compared to the
               single-target condition, in relation to time constraints and
               target-separation-angles. The results showed that the
               participants frequently used the choice-reaction even under tight
               time constraints, and their performance was consistently lower
               than that in the single-target condition. Additionally, in the
               double-target condition, differences in the movement trajectory
               depending on the time constraint and target-separation angle were
               confirmed. Specifically, the longer the time constraint, the
               higher the frequency of the intermediate behavior (to initiate
               movement toward the intermediate direction of two targets) or the
               change-of-mind behavior (to change the aiming target during
               movement). Furthermore, the smaller the target-separation angle,
               the higher the frequency of intermediate behavior, but the
               frequency of change-of-mind was not affected by the
               target-separation angle. These results suggest that the
               participants initiated the movement at an incomplete value
               judgment stage in some trials. Furthermore, they seemed to select
               a strategy to utilize the information obtained during the
               movement, taking into account the time constraints and
               target-separation angle. Our results show a consistent cognitive
               bias in choosing a higher value when multiple alternatives have
               different values. Additionally, we also suggest flexibility and

               systems responsible for language production and comprehension

               York, NY: Oxford University Press, 2007]. We explore the
               alternative hypothesis that maintenance in VWM is subserved by
               temporary activation of the language production system [Acheson,
               D. J., \& MacDonald, M. C. Verbal working memory and language
               production: Common approaches to the serial ordering of verbal
               information. Psychological Bulletin, 135, 50-68, 2009b].
               Specifically, we hypothesized that for stimuli lacking a semantic
               representation (e.g., nonwords such as mun), maintenance in VWM
               can be achieved by cycling information back and forth between the
               stages of phonological encoding and articulatory planning. First,
               fMRI was used to identify regions associated with two different
               stages of language production planning: the posterior superior
               temporal gyrus (pSTG) for phonological encoding (critical for VWM
               of nonwords) and the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) for
               lexical-semantic retrieval (not critical for VWM of nonwords).
               Next, in the same subjects, these regions were targeted with
               repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) during
               language production and VWM task performance. Results showed that
               rTMS to the pSTG, but not the MTG, increased error rates on paced
               reading (a language production task) and on delayed serial recall
               of nonwords (a test of VWM). Performance on a lexical-semantic
               retrieval task (picture naming), in contrast, was significantly
               sensitive to rTMS of the MTG. Because rTMS was guided by language
               production-related activity, these results provide the first
               causal evidence that maintenance in VWM directly depends on the

               this construct is commonly overlooked. In contrast,

               whether, as it is commonly measured (i.e., with computer-based
               stimuli and button-based responses), working memory involved the
               planning of motor actions (i.e., specific button presses). Next,

	abstract = {AbstractWorking memory is typically described as a set of
               processes that allow for the maintenance and manipulation of
               information for proximal actions, yet the ``action'' portion of
               this construct is commonly overlooked. In contrast,
               neuroscience-informed theories of working memory have emphasized
               the hierarchical nature of memory representations, including both
               goals and sensory representations. These two representational
               domains are combined for the service of actions. Here, we tested
               whether, as it is commonly measured (i.e., with computer-based
               stimuli and button-based responses), working memory involved the
               planning of motor actions (i.e., specific button presses). Next,
               we examined the role of motor plan learning in successful working
               memory performance. Results showed that visual working memory
               performance was disrupted by unpredictable motor mappings,
               indicating a role for motor planning in working memory. Further,
               predictable motor mappings were in fact learned over the course
               of the experiment, thereby causing the measure of working memory
               to be partially a measure of participants' ability to learn
               arbitrary associations between visual stimuli and motor
               responses. Such learning was not highly specific to certain
               mappings; in sequences of short tasks, participants improved in
               their abilities to learn to represent items as actions in working
               memory. We discuss implications for working memory theories in
               light of hierarchical structure learning and ecological validity.},

              between processes related to strategic control and processes
              related to motor adaptation. These processes may operate on very
              different error signals. Strategy learning is sensitive to
              goal-based performance error. In contrast, adaptation is sensitive
              to prediction errors between the desired and actual consequences
              of a planned movement. The former guides what the desired movement
              should be, whereas the latter guides how to implement the desired
              movement. Whereas traditional approaches have favored serial
              models in which an initial strategy-based phase gives way to more
              automatized forms of control, it now seems that strategic and

              motor function are based on 'optimal performance': they quantify

              healthy human participants performed bimanual anticipatory

              were more variable and slowed to a greater extent during the

              associations between motor actions and their effects in the
              environment have been formed, the anticipation of these effects
              will automatically activate the associated motor pattern. R-E
              learning is typically investigated with (induction) experiments
              that comprise an acquisition phase, where R-E associations are
              presumably learned, and a subsequent test phase, where the
              previous effects serve as stimuli for a response. While most
              studies used stimuli in the test phase that were identical to the
              effects in the acquisition phase, one study reported
              generalization from exemplars to their superordinate category

              Therefore, it is controversial about effective intervention
              methods focusing on brain function. One of the rehabilitation

              most studies involve adults and healthy children, and the MI
              method for children with DCD has not been studied in detail.

              frontal gyrus and middle frontal gyrus, lower fractional
              anisotropy, and axial diffusivity in regions of white matter
              pathways were found in DCD. As a result of the review, children
              with DCD had less activation of the left brain, especially those
              with mirror neurons system (MNS) and sensory integration
              functions. On the contrary, the area important for the visual
              space processing of the right brain was activated. Regarding of
              characteristic of the MI methods was that children observed a
              video related to motor skills before the intervention. Also, they
              performed visual-motor tasks before MI training sessions. Adding
              action observation during MI activates the MNS, and performing
              visual-motor tasks activates the basal ganglia. These methods may
              improve the deactivated brain regions of children with DCD and may
              be useful as conditioning before starting training. Furthermore,
              we propose a process for sharing the contents of MI with the
              therapist in language and determining exercise strategies.

               processing leads to a decision, and the outcome is passed to the
               motor system to be converted into action. Recently, it has been
               suggested that the decision process may provide a continuous flow

               function remain elusive. Here, we employ projection-specific
               imaging and perturbation methods to investigate the direct
               pathway linking two key nodes in the motor planning network, the
               secondary motor cortex (M2) and the midbrain superior colliculus
               (SC), in mice performing a memory-dependent perceptual decision
               task. We find dynamic coding of choice information in
               SC-projecting M2 neurons during motor planning and execution, and
               disruption of this information by inhibiting M2 terminals in SC

              missing. On the perceptual side, the dominant cognitive view
              largely underestimates, and thus fails to account for, the impact
              of action-related processes on both the processing of perceptual
              information and on perceptual learning. On the action side, most

              have suggested that conscious intention emerges in the mesial
              precentral area (MPA) including the supplementary and
              pre-supplementary motor area. However, this assumption was later
              challenged by evidence indicating a key contribution of the
              inferior parietal lobule (IPL) in this process. In this review we
              show that this second hypothesis is the most plausible. We provide
              behavioral, clinical and electrophysiological evidence that IPL,
              rather than MPA, mediates the early subjective experience of
              'wanting to move'. We argue that MPA generates a feeling of 'motor
              urge', near movement onset, when the inhibitory control exerted on
              the low-level motor areas is released. We propose that goal
              directed actions trigger two forms of motor intention: the first,
              'wanting to move' intention is under the control of the inferior
              parietal regions and specifies a general goal to be reached before
              movement planning; the second, the 'urge to move' intention, is
              controlled by mesial precentral areas and signals the time when
              the planned movement is about to start. The time locked activation

               point of motor systems neuroscience. Where does the difficulty
               lie? A great deal has been known about biomechanics for quite
               some time. More recently, there have been significant advances in
               our understanding of how the spinal system is organized into
               modules corresponding to spinal synergies, which are fixed
               patterns of multimuscle recruitment. But much less is known about
               how the supraspinal system recruits these synergies in the
               correct spatiotemporal pattern to effectively control movement.
               We argue that what makes the problem of supraspinal control so
               difficult is that it emerges as a result of multiple convergent
               and redundant sensorimotor loops. Because these loops are
               convergent, multiple modes of information are mixed before being
               sent to the spinal system; because they are redundant,
               information is overlapping such that a mechanism must exist to
               eliminate the redundancy before the signal is sent to the spinal
               system. Given these complex interactions, simple correlation
               analyses between movement variables and neural activity are
               likely to render a confusing and inconsistent picture. Here, we
               suggest that the perspective of sensorimotor loops might help in
               achieving a better systems-level understanding. Furthermore,
               state-of-the-art techniques in neurotechnology, such as
               optogenetics, appear to be well suited for investigating the

              accurately is critical for many motor skills. Although training
              improves performance in a large variety of motor sequence tasks,
              the precise mechanisms behind such improvements are poorly
              understood. Here we investigated the contribution of single-action
              selection, sequence preplanning, online planning, and motor
              execution to performance in a discrete sequence production task.
              Five visually presented numbers cued a sequence of five finger
              presses, which had to be executed as quickly and accurately as
              possible. To study how sequence planning influenced sequence
              production, we manipulated the amount of time that participants
              were given to prepare each sequence by using a forced-response
              paradigm. Over 4 days, participants were trained on 10 sequences
              and tested on 80 novel sequences. Our results revealed that
              participants became faster in selecting individual finger presses.
              They also preplanned three or four sequence items into the future,
              and the speed of preplanning improved for trained, but not for
              untrained, sequences. Because preplanning capacity remained
              limited, the remaining sequence elements had to be planned online
              during sequence execution, a process that also improved with
              sequence-specific training. Overall, our results support the view
              that motor sequence learning effects are best characterized by
              improvements in planning processes that occur both before and
              concurrently with motor execution. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Complex

              question addressed with the method is how the choice reaction time

              subject was primed to perform. We explore the method in a study of
              manual response selection where we investigate the effects of
              requiring that two possible responses use the same finger or hand.
              A requirement of the method --- that subjects get ready to perform
              primed responses only --- is not met in some conditions of the
              experiment. When the two possible responses are made with
              different hands, it appears that multiple response preparation
              occurs prior to detection of the reaction signal, whereas when the

              labor the brain has to perform in order to retrieve the linguistic

              psycholinguistic research in the field of language production has
              focused on the net result of time required to utter words in
              various experimental conditions, over the last years more and more
              researchers pursued the objective to flesh out the time course of
              particular stages implicated in language production. Here we
              critically review these studies, with particular interest for the
              time course of lexical selection. First, we evaluate the data
              underlying the estimates of an influential temporal meta-analysis
              on language production (Indefrey and Levelt, 2004). We conclude
              that those data alone are not sufficient to provide a reliable
              time frame of lexical selection. Next, we discuss recent
              neurophysiological evidence which we argue to offer more explicit
              insights into the time course of lexical selection. Based on this
              evidence we suggest that, despite the absence of a clear time
              frame of how long lexical selection takes, there is sufficient
              direct evidence to conclude that the brain initiates lexical
              access within 200 ms after stimulus presentation, hereby
              confirming Indefrey and Levelt's estimate. In a final section, we
              briefly review the proposed mechanisms which could lead to this
              rapid onset of lexical access, namely automatic spreading
              activation versus specific concept selection, and discuss novel
              data which support the notion of spreading activation, but
              indicate that the speed with which this principle takes effect is

              interwoven, and that this interweaving is what enables people to
              predict themselves and each other. We start by noting that
              production and comprehension are forms of action and action
              perception. We then consider the evidence for interweaving in
              action, action perception, and joint action, and explain such
              evidence in terms of prediction. Specifically, we assume that
              actors construct forward models of their actions before they
              execute those actions, and that perceivers of others' actions
              covertly imitate those actions, then construct forward models of

               underlying action planning and execution outside of the song
               system are largely unknown. We recorded single-neuron activity

               task. The crows were instructed to plan an impending movement
               toward one of eight possible targets on the left or right side of
               a touchscreen. In a fraction of trials, the crows were prompted

               songbirds have become exciting new models for understanding
               complex cognitive behavior. As a key neural underpinning, the
               endbrain area nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL) represents sensory
               and memory-related task components. How such representations are
               converted into goal-directed motor output remained unknown. In
               crows, we report that NCL neurons are involved in the planning
               and execution of goal-directed movements. NCL neurons
               prospectively signaled motion directions in instructed trials,
               but also when the crows were free to choose a target. NCL neurons
               showed a target-specific sharpening of tuning with the transition
               from the planning to the execution period. Thus, the avian NCL
               not only represents high-level sensory and cognitive task
               components, but also transforms relevant information into action
               plans and motor execution.},

              improvement of recovery revealed by kinematic variables. The
              results corroborate our previous hypothesis that only timing of

              PFC contributes to the recall of pre-existing motor programs whose
              onset timing is adjusted by the OFC. Hence, learning is clearly
              divided into two steps delineated by the switch in activity of the
              OFC. Additionally, motor processes appear to share the working
              memory as well as decisional and predictive resources of the

              participants' choices as a function of the ambiguity of the visual
              stimulus. Typically, the reporting movement is considered as a
              mere means of reporting the decision with no influence on the

              and in what order. Such choice behavior can be assessed from an
              optimal foraging perspective whereby target selection is shaped by
              a balance between rewards and costs. Here we evaluated such
              decision-making in a rapid movement foraging task. On a given
              trial, participants were presented with 15 targets of varying size
              and value and were instructed to harvest as much reward as
              possible by either moving a handle to the targets (hand task) or
              by briefly fixating them (eye task). The short trial duration
              enabled participants to harvest about half the targets, ensuring
              that total reward was due to choice behavior. We developed a
              probabilistic model to predict target-by-target harvesting choices
              that considered the rewards and movement-related costs (i.e.,
              target distance and size) associated with the current target as

              tend to prefer the one that requires the least effort. Recent
              studies have shown that humans are remarkably accurate at
              evaluating the effort of potential reaching actions and can
              predict the subtle energetic demand caused by the nonisotropic
              biomechanical properties of the arm. In the present study, we
              investigated the time course over which such information is
              computed and comes to influence decisions. Two independent
              approaches were used. First, subjects performed a reach decision
              task in which the time interval for deciding between two candidate
              reaching actions was varied from 200 to 800 ms. Second, we
              measured motor-evoked potential (MEPs) to single-pulse
              transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the primary motor
              cortex (M1) to probe the evolving decision at different times

              conclusion: that a prediction of the effort associated with
              candidate movements is computed very quickly and influences
              decisions within 200 ms after presentation of the candidate
              actions. Furthermore, whereas the MEPs measured 150 ms after
              stimulus presentation were well correlated with the choices that
              subjects ultimately made, later in the trial the MEP amplitudes
              were primarily related to the muscular requirements of the chosen
              movement. This suggests that corticospinal excitability (CSE)
              initially reflects a competition between candidate actions and

              suggested that implicit knowledge about biomechanics may also
              exert some influence on the planning of reaching movements. Here,

              mind to revise the action. Such changes of mind can even occur
              when the stream of information that led to the action is curtailed
              at movement onset. This is explained by the time delays in sensory
              processing and motor planning which lead to a component at the end
              of the sensory stream that can only be processed after initiation.
              Such post-initiation processing can explain the pattern of changes
              of mind by asserting an accumulation of additional evidence to a
              criterion level, termed change-of-mind bound. Here we test the
              hypothesis that physical effort associated with the movement
              required to change one's mind affects the level of the
              change-of-mind bound and the time for post-initiation

              choice target to another in a reaching movement by varying the
              geometry of the choice targets or by applying a force field
              between the targets. We show that there is a reduction in the
              frequency of change of mind when the separation of the choice
              targets would require a larger excursion of the hand from the
              initial to the opposite choice. The reduction is best explained by
              an increase in the evidence required for changes of mind and a
              reduced time period of integration after the initial decision.

               for a certain action. It has been suggested that for this
               decision the brain calculates expected costs based on action
               values, such as expected biomechanical costs, expected success
               rate, handedness, and skillfulness. Although these conclusions
               were based on experiments in stationary subjects, we often act
               while the body is in motion. We investigated how hand choice is
               affected by passive body motion, which directly affects the
               biomechanical costs of the arm movement due to its inertia. With
               the use of a linear motion platform, 12 right-handed subjects
               were sinusoidally translated (0.625 and 0.5 Hz). At 8 possible
               motion phases, they had to reach, using either their left or
               right hand, to a target presented at 1 of 11 possible locations.
               We predicted hand choice by calculating the expected
               biomechanical costs under different assumptions about the future
               acceleration involved in these computations, being the
               forthcoming acceleration during the reach, the instantaneous
               acceleration at target onset, or zero acceleration as if the body
               were stationary. Although hand choice was generally biased to use
               of the dominant hand, it also modulated sinusoidally with the
               motion, with the amplitude of the bias depending on the motion?s
               peak acceleration. The phase of hand choice modulation was
               consistent with the cost model that took the instantaneous
               acceleration signal at target onset. This suggests that the brain

               predictions about future accelerations, when deciding on hand
               choice during passive whole body motion. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY
               Decisions of hand choice are a fundamental aspect of human
               behavior. Whereas these decisions are typically studied in
               stationary subjects, this study examines hand choice while
               subjects are in motion. We show that accelerations of the body,
               which differentially modulate the biomechanical costs of left and
               right hand movements, are also taken into account when deciding
               which hand to use for a reach, possibly based on bottom-up

              frontoparietal cortex and compete in a manner biased by any factor
              relevant to the decision. We tested this hypothesis by recording
              single-unit activity in dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) while a
              monkey performed two delayed center-out reaching tasks. In the
              one-target task, a single target was presented and its border
              style indicated its reward value. The two-target task was the same
              except two targets were presented and the value of each was
              varied. During the delay period of the one-target task,
              directionally tuned PMd activity showed no modulation with value.
              In contrast, during the two-target task, the same neurons showed
              strong effects of the value associated with their preferred

              Furthermore, the competition between action choices was strongest
              when targets were furthest apart. This angular distance effect
              appeared in neural activity as soon as cells became tuned, while
              modulation by relative value appeared much later. All of these
              findings can be reproduced by a computational model which suggests
              that decisions between actions are made through a biased

               but must wait for more information before knowing which to
               perform. Movement scientists have long asked whether in these
               delayed-response situations the brain plans both potential
               movements simultaneously, or if it simply chooses one and then
               switches later if necessary. To answer this question, we used
               simultaneously recorded activity from populations of neurons in
               macaque dorsal premotor cortex to track moment-by-moment
               deliberation between two potential reach targets. We found that
               the neural activity only ever indicated a single-reach plan (with
               some targets favored more than others), and that initial plans
               often predicted the monkeys' behavior on both Free-Choice trials
               and incorrect Cued trials. Our results suggest that premotor
               cortex plans only one option at a time, and that decisions are
               strongly influenced by the initial response to the available set
               of movement options. It is debated whether motor cortical
               activity reflects plans for multiple potential actions. Here, the
               authors report that in a delayed response task with two potential
               reach targets, population activity in the dorsal premotor cortex
               at any moment in time represents only one of the targets.},

              (43\%) task-related, directionally tuned cells in dorsal premotor
              cortex (PMd) discharged if one of the targets was near their
              preferred direction. At the population level, this generated two

              fundamental pragmatic problems: selection between actions that are
              currently possible and specification of the parameters or metrics
              of those actions. It is commonly suggested that the brain
              addresses these by first constructing representations of the world
              on which to build knowledge and make a decision, and then by
              computing and executing an action plan. However,
              neurophysiological data argue against this serial viewpoint. In
              contrast, it is proposed here that the brain processes sensory
              information to specify, in parallel, several potential actions
              that are currently available. These potential actions compete
              against each other for further processing, while information is
              collected to bias this competition until a single response is
              selected. The hypothesis suggests that the dorsal visual system
              specifies actions which compete against each other within the
              fronto-parietal cortex, while a variety of biasing influences are
              provided by prefrontal regions and the basal ganglia. A
              computational model is described, which illustrates how this
              competition may take place in the cerebral cortex. Simulations of
              the model capture qualitative features of neurophysiological data

               five experiments (total N = 1410), we provide evidence for a
               probability raising account holding that people are more likely
               to see the outcome of an agent's action as intentional if the
               agent does something to increase the odds of that outcome.
               Experiment 1 found that high probability without probability
               raising does not suffice for strong attributions of
               intentionality. Participants were more likely to conclude a girl
               intentionally obtained a desired gumball from a single gumball
               machine when it offered favorable odds for getting that kind of
               gumball compared with when it offered poor odds, but their
               attributions of intentionality were lukewarm. Experiments 2 and 3

               raised her probability of success by choosing to use machines
               offering favorable odds over machines offering poor odds.
               Finally, Experiments 4 and 5 examined whether these effects of
               probability raising might reduce to consideration of agents'
               beliefs and expectations. We found that although these mental

               attribute intentional actions to agents who increase their odds
               of success, rather than to agents who merely become convinced
               that success is likely. We discuss the implications of these

              more consistent with the ``given-before-new'' information
              structure, and might also be easier to integrate because the head
              noun is available before the modifications are encountered. In 4
              experiments, we investigated whether premodified (the cruel and
              merciless king), and postmodified (the king who was cruel and
              merciless) noun phrases (henceforth, NPs) could induce variations
              in ease of subsequent retrieval. In Experiments 1, 2, and 3,
              participants used more pronouns (he), as opposed to full
              descriptions (the king) to refer to postmodified NPs than to
              unmodified competitors, but pronominal reference to premodified
              NPs and unmodified competitors did not differ, suggesting that
              postmodified NPs are more accessible in memory. When the data from
              all 3 experiments were combined, we also observed significantly
              more pronominal reference to post- than to premodified NPs, as
              well as a greater increase in pronominal reference rates between
              postmodified NPs and unmodified competitors than between
              premodified NPs and unmodified competitors. In Experiment 4, words
              following critical pronouns were read faster when the pronouns

              structures, they place longer and more complex dependents further
              away from the head word to which they belong than shorter and
              simpler dependents, and that they do so with increasing rigidity
              the longer expressions get, for example, longer objects tend to be
              placed further away from their verb, and with less variation.
              Current theories of sentence processing furthermore make competing
              predictions on whether longer expressions are preferentially
              placed as early or as late as possible. Here we test these
              predictions using hierarchical distributional regression models
              that allow estimates of word order and word order variation at the
              level of individual dependencies in corpora from 71 languages,
              while controlling for confounding effects from the type of
              dependency (e.g., subject vs. object), and the type of clause
              (main vs. subordinate) involved as well as from trends that are
              characteristic of individual languages, language families, and
              language contact areas. Our results show the expected correlations
              of length with position and variation only for two out of six
              dependency types (obliques and nominal modifiers) and no

              theories of across-the-board effects of complexity on word order

	abstract = {That speakers can vary their speaking rate is evident, but how
              they accomplish this has hardly been studied. Consider this
              analogy: When walking, speed can be continuously increased, within
              limits, but to speed up further, humans must run. Are there
              multiple qualitatively distinct speech ``gaits'' that resemble
              walking and running? Or is control achieved by continuous
              modulation of a single gait? This study investigates these
              possibilities through simulations of a new connectionist
              computational model of the cognitive process of speech production,
              EPONA, that borrows from Dell, Burger, and Svec's (1997) model.
              The model has parameters that can be adjusted to fit the temporal
              characteristics of speech at different speaking rates. We trained
              the model on a corpus of disyllabic Dutch words produced at
              different speaking rates. During training, different clusters of
              parameter values (regimes) were identified for different speaking
              rates. In a 1-gait system, the regimes used to achieve fast and
              slow speech are qualitatively similar, but quantitatively
              different. In a multiple gait system, there is no linear
              relationship between the parameter settings associated with each
              gait, resulting in an abrupt shift in parameter values to move
              from speaking slowly to speaking fast. After training, the model
              achieved good fits in all three speaking rates. The parameter
              settings associated with each speaking rate were not linearly
              related, suggesting the presence of cognitive gaits. Thus, we
              provide the first computationally explicit account of the ability
              to modulate the speech production system to achieve different
              speaking styles. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all

	abstract = {ABSTRACTLanguage comprehension proceeds at a very fast pace. It
               is argued that context influences the speed of language
               comprehension by providing informative cues. How syntactic
               contextual information influences the processing of incoming
               words is, however, less known. Here we employed a masked
               syntactic priming paradigm in four behavioural experiments in the
               German language to test whether masked primes automatically
               influence the categorisation of nouns and verbs. We found robust
               syntactic priming effects with masked primes but only when verbs
               were morpho-syntactically marked. Furthermore, we found that,
               compared to baseline, primes slow down target categorisation when
               the relationship between prime and target is syntactically
               incorrect, rather than speeding it up when the relationship is
               syntactically correct. This argues in favour of an inhibitory
               nature of syntactic priming. Overall, the data indicate that
               humans automatically extract syntactic features from the context

              in this study, participants were presented with spatial images and
              were required to plan the generation of gestures or spoken words
              to represent the same spatial situations. The evoked potentials in
              response to spatial images were recorded to analyze the effective

               overlap of these conditions. The above pathologies are sensitive
               to altered activation and kinetics of dopamine $$D\_{1}$$ D 1 and

               learning and recall. Recognizing start and stop elements of motor
               and cognitive behaviors has crucial importance. During chunking,
               frequent components of temporal strings are concatenated into
               single units. We extended a published computational model
               (Asabuki et al. 2018), where two populations of neurons are
               connected and simulated in a reservoir computing framework. These
               neural pools were adopted to represent D1 and D2 striatal
               neuronal populations. We investigated how specific neural and
               striatal circuit parameters can influence start/stop signaling

               synaptic weights and differential time constants may contribute
               to signaling of start/stop elements within learned sequences.
               Asymmetric coupling between the striatal $$D\_{1}$$ D 1 and
               $$D\_{2}$$ D 2 neural populations was also demonstrated to be

               to the end of the corridor, transferred the balls from the bucket
               into a bowl, carried the bucket back to the start position, and
               then did the same with the other remaining bucket. As in an
               earlier study where just one of two buckets had to be carried to
               the end of a corridor (Rosenbaum et al. Psychol Sci
               25(7):1487-1496, 2014), participants showed a marked tendency to
               start with the near bucket. The near-bucket preference was
               modulated only to a small extent by the number of balls that
               could be emptied into the bowl. The relative lack of importance
               of the number of balls to be transferred (to finish the first
               task more quickly or to get closer to the end goal of
               transferring all balls into the bowl) was further demonstrated by
               the fact that the effect of the number of balls to be transferred
               did not depend on how the emptying was supposed to occur (by
               pouring the balls or placing the balls one at a time into the
               bowl), or by whether the instruction focused on filling the bowl
               or emptying the buckets. The results suggest that the near-bucket
               preference reflects a strong inclination to start the task
               (sub-goal) as soon as possible rather than complete the task
               (sub-goal) as soon as possible. Starting the task as soon as
               possible may be related to the affordance triggered by the sight
               of the near object or by the freedom to perform without having to
               inhibit a reach for a bucket when the performer is empty-handed.
               Starting a task sooner may free up cognitive resources for
               subsequent decision-making.},

	abstract = {A great deal of research has concerned choices of goods or
               services with different values receivable at various times.
               Temporal discounting - the magnification of values that can be
               obtained sooner rather than later - has proven to be immensely
               important in this regard. In the present article, we shift the
               focus from the receipt of goods or services to the performance of
               tasks. We show that temporal discounting also applies to task
               choices. Pre-crastination, the phenomenon we point to, was
               discovered by Rosenbaum, Gong, and Potts (2014) and is the
               tendency to hasten tasks even at the expense of extra energy.
               Pre-crastination was discovered in a study of psycho-motor
               performance, where the focus was on biomechanical factors
               affecting task choices. In the present article, we review that
               research, showing how the tendency found in the initial
               experiments are in fact illustrative of a more general
               motor-control tendency to inhibit easy forms of movement for the
               sake of later performance goals. Such inhibitory control may also
               be the basis for pre-crastination, provided one assumes that
               pre-crastination keeps working memory as clear as possible. A
               wide range of behavioral choices fit under the rubric of
               pre-crastination, such as answering emails too soon, submitting
               articles before they are ready, judging others before they should
               be judged, convicting others to get cases over with, and, in the
               worst case, going to war prematurely. Lack of temperance in these
               choices may seem to arise from impulsivity, but we argue against
               that view. The desire to ``clear the decks'' to be prepared for
               new challenges is, we suggest, a more apt account of
               pre-crastination.},

	abstract = {Research on motor planning has revealed two seemingly
               contradictory phenomena. One is the end-state comfort effect, the
               tendency to grasp objects in physically awkward ways for the sake
               of comfortable or easy-to-control final postures (Rosenbaum et
               al., Attention and Performance XIII: Motor representation and
               control, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Hillsdale, New Jersey,
               1990). The other is pre-crastination, the tendency to hasten the
               completion of tasks even at the expense of extra physical effort
               (Rosenbaum et al., Psychol Sci 25:1487-1496, 2014). End-state
               comfort seems to reflect emphasis on final states, whereas
               pre-crastination seems to reflect emphasis on initial states. How
               can both effects exist? We sought to resolve this seeming
               conflict by noting, first, that the effects have been tested in
               different contexts. End-state comfort has been tested with
               grasping, whereas pre-crastination has been tested with walking
               plus grasping. Second, both effects may reflect planning that
               aids aiming, as already demonstrated for end-state comfort but
               not yet tested for pre-crastination. We tested the two effects in
               a single walk-and-grasp task and found that demands on aiming
               influenced both effects, although precrastination was not fully
               influenced by changes in the demands of aiming. We conclude that
               end-state comfort and precrastination are both aiming-related,
               but that precrastination also reflects a desire to hasten early
               task completion.},

               can be started or completed sooner (precrastination) even if it
               requires more physical effort. Evidence from transport tasks
               suggests that precrastination can reduce cognitive effort and
               will likely not occur if it increases cognitive effort. However,
               some individuals precrastinate even when it increases cognitive
               effort. We examined whether individual differences in working
               memory capacity (WMC) influence this suboptimal choice.
               Participants retrieved two cups of water along a corridor, in the
               order of their choosing. We measured the frequency of choosing
               the close cup first (precrastination) while varying water levels
               in each cup (attention demand) located at different distances.
               Results showed that the tendency to select the far cup first
               (avoid precrastination) increases when the close cup is full
               (high attention demand) vs. not full (low attention demand).
               Post-hoc results showed high (vs. low) WMC individuals more
               frequently bypass decisions with relatively higher costs of
               cognitive effort, avoiding precrastination when the attentional
               demand of carrying the close (vs. far) cup is relatively high
               (close-cup full and far-cup half full), but not when it is
               relatively low (far-cup full). However, there was no evidence
               that WMC could explain why some individuals always
               precrastinated, at costs of cognitive effort. Instead,
               individuals who always precrastinated reported automatic
               behavior, and those who avoided precrastinating reported
               decisions of efficiency. Learning, the relationship between
               precrastination and tendencies to enjoy/engage in thinking or
               procrastinate, and evidence that precrastination required more
               cognitive effort in our task, are discussed.},

	abstract = {People often try to complete tasks as soon as possible, even at
               the expense of extra effort-a phenomenon called precrastination
               (Rosenbaum et al., 2014). Because precrastination is so
               widespread-as in answering emails too quickly, submitting papers
               before they have been polished, or, on larger scales, convicting
               people in the rush to judgment, or even going to war in the rush
               for revenge-it is important to understand its basis. Building on
               previous work on this phenomenon, we focused on two plausible
               accounts of it. According to the behavioral account, there is a
               desire to act for the sake of acting itself. According to the
               cognitive account, there is a desire to shorten one's mental
               to-do list so cognitive resources can be directed to other
               things. We invented a new task to distinguish between these
               hypotheses. Our participants made yes-no decisions under the
               requirement that they always respond twice per trial. We found
               that participants took longer for the first choice than the
               second and rarely changed their minds, even when second response
               accuracy was emphasized. This outcome went against the behavioral
               account, which predicted shorter first-response times than
               second-response times and lower (near chance) first-response
               accuracies than second-response accuracies. Instead, the data
               clearly showed that participants did all or most of their
               decision-making up front. The double-response reaction time task
               provides a new tool for studying decision dynamics. (PsycInfo

               to embark on tasks as soon as possible, even at the expense of
               extra physical effort. We examined the generality of this
               recently discovered phenomenon by extending the methods used to
               study it, mainly to test the hypothesis that precrastination is
               motivated by cognitive load reduction. Our participants picked up
               two objects and brought them back together. Participants in
               Experiment 1 demonstrated precrastination by picking up the near
               object first, carrying it back to the farther object, and then
               returning with both. Also, participants given an additional
               cognitive task (memory load) had a higher probability of
               precrastinating than those not given the added cognitive task.
               The objects in Experiment 1 were buckets with balls that had a
               very low chance of spillage; carrying them required low demands
               on attention. The near-object-first preference was eliminated in
               Experiment 2, where the near and far objects were cups with water
               that had a high chance of spillage; carrying them required higher
               demands on attention. Had precrastination occurred in this case,
               it would have greatly increased cognitive effort. The results
               establish the generality of precrastination and suggest that it
               is sensitive to cognitive load. Our results complement others
               showing that people tend to structure their behavior to minimize
               cognitive effort. The main new discovery is that people expend
               more physical effort to do so. We discuss the applied
               implications of our findings, as well as the possibility that

               early even at the expense of extra effort (Rosenbaum et al.,

               this way to free up cognitive resources, known as the CLEAR
               hypothesis (VonderHaar et al., 2019), particularly when given
               simple task choices. In the current study, this task choice
               behavior was compared across cognitive tasks to explore its
               generalizability. In Experiment 1, simple math problems were
               placed on boxes within a box moving task to be solved to
               determine box moving order. Participants were asked to generate
               category items during the box moving task at a time of their
               choosing, and the trial position they chose was measured. In
               Experiment 2, item generation and simple math problem tasks were
               compared during the box moving task on the same measure. In
               addition, individual difference measures of impulsiveness
               (Experiment 1) and self-regulation (Experiment 2) were included
               to investigate possible relations between task order choices and
               these traits. In Experiment 1, when math problems were added to
               the boxes, no significant precrastination was found and
               difficulty of the category affected trial position in only one
               order condition. In Experiment 2, high precrastination rates were
               found for both math problem and item generation tasks. However,
               there were no correlations between impulsiveness or
               self-regulation and trial positions for these tasks. These
               results suggest that task order choices for cognitive tasks may

               university students to pick up either of two buckets, one to the
               left of an alley and one to the right, and to carry the selected
               bucket to the alley's end. In most trials, one of the buckets was
               closer to the end point. We emphasized choosing the easier task,
               expecting participants to prefer the bucket that would be carried
               a shorter distance. Contrary to our expectation, participants
               chose the bucket that was closer to the start position, carrying
               it farther than the other bucket. On the basis of results from
               nine experiments and participants' reports, we concluded that
               this seemingly irrational choice reflected a tendency to
               pre-crastinate, a term we introduce to refer to the hastening of
               subgoal completion, even at the expense of extra physical effort.

               The other is the Specificational Copular Clause (SCC)
               construction, where there are two nominative arguments. A
               much-discussed aspect of agreement in the former case is that
               agreement in number with the low nominative is generally
               possible, but agreement in person is at best highly restricted,
               leading in some cases to ineffability. This person effect has
               been claimed to be ameliorated by syncretism in the agreement
               paradigm, but there is limited data available substantiating this
               effect, which is however crucial to deciding between two recent
               types of account. This paper reports on a pair of experimental
               rating studies on the Dat-Nom and SCC configurations in
               Icelandic. We show that, taken together, the two sets of data
               provide evidence against the Person Licensing Condition and in
               favour of an account of the Dat-Nom construction in terms of
               morphological conflict arising from double agreement, although we
               show that the ameliorating effect of morphological syncretism,
               while real, is limited. Further, we show that there is no
               evidence of double agreement in the copular clauses investigated.
               We argue that full agreement with the low nominative here arises
               if the first nominal can move out of the domain of agreement
               entirely. The possibility of agreement with the initial nominal
               we suggest indicates that nominatives, unlike datives, cause the
               search of the agreement probe to terminate.},

               serial order process. The question is addressed empirically in
               two experiments that compare performance in whole report tasks
               that tap perception, serial recall tasks that tap memory, and
               copy typing tasks that tap action, using the same materials and
               participants. The data show similar effects across tasks that
               differ in magnitude, which is consistent with a single process
               operating under different constraints. The question is addressed
               theoretically by developing a Context Retrieval and Updating
               (CRU) theory of serial order, fitting it to the data from the two
               experiments, and generating predictions for 7 different summary
               measures of performance: list accuracy, serial position effects,
               transposition gradients, contiguity effects, error magnitudes,
               error types, and error ratios. Versions of the model that allowed
               sensitivity in perception and memory to decrease with serial
               position fit the data best and produced reasonably accurate
               predictions for everything but error ratios. Together, the
               theoretical and empirical results suggest a positive answer to

              hierarchy-a set of prioritized requirements defining the task to
              be performed. For grasping, constraints include avoiding
              collisions with to-be-grasped objects and minimizing
              movement-related effort. These and other constraints are combined
              with instance retrieval (recall of stored postures) and instance
              generation (generation of new postures and movements to them) to
              simulate flexible prehension. Dynamic deadline setting is used to
              regulate termination of instance generation, and performance of

               and empirical work on motor representations and motor control
               (Pacherie, 2008). The model distinguished among Distal
               intentions, Proximal intentions, and Motor intentions operating
               at different levels of action control (hence the name DPM model).
               This model specified the representational and functional profiles
               of each type of intention, as well their local and global
               dynamics, and the ways in which they interact. A core insight of
               the model was that action control is the result of integrated,

	abstract = {Much of our everyday, embodied action comes in the form of smooth
               coping. Smooth coping is skillful action that has become
               habituated and ingrained, generally placing less stress on
               cognitive load than considered and deliberative thought and
               action. When performed with skill and expertise, walking,
               driving, skiing, musical performances, and short-order cooking
               are all examples of the phenomenon. Smooth coping is
               characterized by its rapidity and relative lack of reflection,
               both being hallmarks of automatization. Deliberative and
               reflective actions provide the contrast case. In Dreyfus' classic
               view, smooth coping is ``mindless'' absorption into action, being
               in the flow, and any reflective thought will only interrupt this
               flow. Building on the pragmatist account of Dewey, others, such
               as Sutton, Montero, and Gallagher, insist on the intelligent
               flexibility built into smooth coping, suggesting that it is not
               equivalent to automatization. We seek to answer two complementary
               challenges in this article. First, how might we model smooth
               coping in autonomous agents (natural or artificial) at fine
               granularity? Second, we use this model of smooth coping to show
               how we might implement smooth coping in artificial intelligent
               agents. We develop a conceptual model of smooth coping in LIDA
               (Learning Intelligent Decision Agent). LIDA is an embodied
               cognitive architecture implementing the global workspace theory
               of consciousness, among other psychological theories. LIDA's
               implementation of consciousness enables us to account for the
               phenomenology of smooth coping, something that few cognitive
               architectures would be able to do. Through the fine granular
               analysis of LIDA, we argue that smooth coping is a sequence of
               automatized actions intermittently interspersed with consciously
               mediated action selection, supplemented by dorsal stream
               processes. In other words, non-conscious, automatized actions
               (whether learned or innate) often require occasional bursts of
               conscious cognition to achieve the skillful and flexible
               adjustments of smooth coping. In addition, never-conscious dorsal
               stream information and associated sensorimotor processes provide
               further online adjustments during smooth coping. To achieve
               smooth coping in LIDA we introduce a new module to the LIDA
               cognitive architecture the Automatized Action Selection
               sub-module. Our complex model of smooth coping borrows notions of
               ``embodied intelligence'' from enactivism and augments these by
               allowing representations and more detailed mechanisms of
               conscious control. We explore several extended examples of smooth
               coping, starting from basic activities like walking and scaling
               up to more complex tasks like driving and short-order cooking.},

               principle of caching has been advanced as a potentially promising
               avenue for studying automaticity. It is roughly understood as a
               means of storing direct input-output associations in a manner
               that supports instant lookup. We raise various concerns that
               should be addressed before the theoretical progress afforded by
               this principle can be evaluated. Is caching merely a metaphor for
               computer caching or is it a computational model that can be used
               to derive testable predictions? How do the short-term and
               long-term effects of automaticity relate to the distinction
               between working memory and long-term memory? Does caching apply
               to stimulus-response associations - as already suggested by
               Logan's instance theory - or to algorithms, too? How much
               practice is required for caching and how does caching depend on
               the task's type? What is the relation between control processes
               and caching as these pertain to the possible suppression of
               automatic processes? Dealing with these questions will arguably
               also advance our understanding of automaticity.},

	abstract = {Cognitive effort is thought to be familiar in everyday life,
               ubiquitous across multiple variations of task and circumstance,
               and integral to cost/benefit computations that are themselves
               central to the proper functioning of cognitive control. In
               particular, cognitive effort is thought to be closely related to
               the assessment of cognitive control's costs. I argue here that
               the construct of cognitive effort, as it is deployed in cognitive
               psychology and neuroscience, is problematically unclear. The
               result is that talk of cognitive effort may paper over
               significant disagreement regarding the nature of cognitive
               effort, and its key functions for cognitive control. I highlight
               key points of disagreement, and several open questions regarding
               what causes cognitive effort, what cognitive effort represents,
               cognitive effort's relationship to action, and cognitive effort's
               relationship to consciousness. I also suggest that pluralism
               about cognitive effort-that cognitive effort may manifest as a
               range of intentional or non-intentional actions the function of
               which is to promote greater success at paradigmatic cognitive
               control tasks-may be a fruitful and irenic way to conceive of
               cognitive effort. Finally, I suggest that recent trends in work
               on cognitive control suggests that we might fruitfully conceive
               of cognitive effort as one key node in a complex network of
               mental value, and that studying this complex network may
               illuminate the nature of cognitive control, and the role of
               consciousness in cognitive control's proper functioning. This

               We conducted a field study of mountain bike riding that required
               a learner rider to cope with major changes in technique and
               equipment. Our results indicate that relatively inexperienced
               individuals can be capable of fairly complex 'on-the-fly' problem
               solving which allows them to cope with new conditions. This
               problem solving is hard to explain for classical theories of
               skill because the adjustments are too large to be achieved by
               automatic mechanisms and too complex and rapid to be achieved by
               cognitive processes as they are usually understood. A recent
               theory, Mesh, can explain these results because it posits that
               skill-specific cognitive abilities develop during skill learning
               and that control typically involves an interplay between
               cognitive and automatic mechanisms. Here we develop Mesh further,
               providing a detailed explanation for these problem solving
               abilities. We argue that causal representation, metacognitive
               awareness and other forms of performance awareness combine in the
               formulation and control of action strategies. We also argue that
               the structure of control present in this case is inconsistent
               with Bratman's model of intentions, and that, in the face of high
               uncertainty and risk, intentions can be much more labile than
               Bratman recognises. In addition, we found limitations and flaws
               in problem solving which illuminate the representations involved.

               by the scope of the representations they engage. Here we examine
               the neural representation of reduplication, a productive
               phonological process that can create novel forms through
               patterned syllable copying (e.g. ba-mih → ba-ba-mih, ba-mih-mih,

               demands. One task that is well-suited to explore control
               adjustments is the stop-signal paradigm, in which subjects must
               balance initiation and inhibition. One common adjustment in the
               stop-signal paradigm is post-stop-signal slowing. Existing models
               of sequential adjustments in the stop-signal paradigm suggest
               that post-stop-signal slowing may be based solely on the events
               of the previous trial, suggesting that post-stop-signal slowing
               is a reflexive byproduct of a stop signal. Alternatively,
               post-stop-signal slowing could be the result of implicit learning
               or strategic adjustment. The authors report three experiments
               that manipulated the probability of stop trial repetition and
               found that these contingencies eliminate, reverse, or greatly

               slowing. These results show that post-stop-signal slowing is not
               a reflexive byproduct of the stop signal. The large changes in
               strategy accompany large changes in task factors, suggesting that

               A single conscious thought automatically produces a series of
               lower-level actions without top-down monitoring. This article
               presents a theory that explains how automatic control is possible
               in skilled typing, where thinking of a word automatically
               produces a rapid series of keystrokes. The theory assumes that
               keystrokes are selected by a context retrieval process that
               matches the current context to stored contexts and retrieves the
               key associated with the best match. The current context is
               generated by the typist's own actions. It represents the goal
               (``type DOG'') and the motor commands for the keys struck so far.
               Top-down control is necessary to start typing. It sets the goal
               in the current context, which initiates the retrieval and
               updating processes, which continue without top-down control until
               the word is finished. The theory explains phenomena of
               hierarchical control in skilled typing, including differential
               loads on higher and lower levels of processing, the importance of
               words, and poor explicit knowledge of key locations and
               finger-to-key mappings. The theory is evaluated by fitting it to
               error corpora from 24 skilled typists and predicting error
               probabilities, magnitudes, and patterns. Some of the fits are
               quite good. The theory has implications beyond typing. It argues
               that control can be automatic and shows how it is possible. The
               theory extends to other sequential skills, like texting or
               playing music. It provides new insights into mechanisms of serial
               order in typing, speaking, and serial recall. (PsycINFO Database

	abstract = {Response inhibition is an important act of control in many
               domains of psychology and neuroscience. It is often studied in a
               stop-signal task that requires subjects to inhibit an ongoing
               action in response to a stop signal. Performance in the
               stop-signal task is understood as a race between a go process
               that underlies the action and a stop process that inhibits the
               action. Responses are inhibited if the stop process finishes
               before the go process. The finishing time of the stop process is
               not directly observable; a mathematical model is required to
               estimate its duration. Logan and Cowan (1984) developed an
               independent race model that is widely used for this purpose. We
               present a general race model that extends the independent race
               model to account for the role of choice in go and stop processes,
               and a special race model that assumes each runner is a stochastic
               accumulator governed by a diffusion process. We apply the models
               to 2 data sets to test assumptions about selective influence of
               capacity limitations on drift rates and strategies on thresholds,
               which are largely confirmed. The model provides estimates of
               distributions of stop-signal response times, which previous
               models could not estimate. We discuss implications of viewing
               cognitive control as the result of a repertoire of acts of

	abstract = {Human speech and birdsong have numerous parallels. Both humans
               and songbirds learn their complex vocalizations early in life,
               exhibiting a strong dependence on hearing the adults they will
               imitate, as well as themselves as they practice, and a waning of
               this dependence as they mature. Innate predispositions for
               perceiving and learning the correct sounds exist in both groups,
               although more evidence of innate descriptions of species-specific
               signals exists in songbirds, where numerous species of vocal
               learners have been compared. Humans also share with songbirds an
               early phase of learning that is primarily perceptual, which then
               serves to guide later vocal production. Both humans and songbirds
               have evolved a complex hierarchy of specialized forebrain areas
               in which motor and auditory centers interact closely, and which
               control the lower vocal motor areas also found in nonlearners. In
               both these vocal learners, however, how auditory feedback of self
               is processed in these brain areas is surprisingly unclear.
               Finally, humans and songbirds have similar critical periods for
               vocal learning, with a much greater ability to learn early in
               life. In both groups, the capacity for late vocal learning may be
               decreased by the act of learning itself, as well as by biological
               factors such as the hormones of puberty. Although some features
               of birdsong and speech are clearly not analogous, such as the
               capacity of language for meaning, abstraction, and flexible
               associations, there are striking similarities in how sensory
               experience is internalized and used to shape vocal outputs, and
               how learning is enhanced during a critical period of development.
               Similar neural mechanisms may therefore be involved.},

               nonlearned rhythmic behaviors or as output pathways for more
               complex, forebrain-generated behaviors. However, the role of the
               brainstem in providing information to the forebrain that is used
               to initiate or assist in the control of complex behaviors is
               poorly understood. In this study, we used electrical
               microstimulation in select nuclei of the avian song system
               combined with recordings of acoustic and respiratory output to
               examine how forebrain and brainstem nuclei interact in the
               generation of learned vocal motor sequences. We found that brief
               stimulation in the forebrain nuclei HVC (used as a proper name)
               and RA (robust nucleus of the arcopallium) caused a short-latency
               truncation of ongoing song syllables, which ultimately led to a
               cessation of the ongoing motor sequence. Stimulation within the
               brainstem inspiratory-related nucleus paraambigualis, which
               receives input from RA and projects back to HVC via the thalamus,
               caused syllable truncations and interruptions similar to those
               observed in HVC and RA. In contrast, stimulation in the
               tracheosyringal portion of the hypoglossal nucleus, which
               innervates the syrinx (the avian vocal organ) but possesses no
               known projections back into the song system, did not cause any
               significant changes in the song motor pattern. These findings
               suggest that perturbation of premotor activity in any nucleus
               within the recurrent song system motor network will disrupt the
               ongoing song motor sequence. Given the anatomical organization of
               this network, our results are consistent with a model in which
               the brainstem respiratory nuclei form an integral part of the
               song motor programming network by providing timing signals to
               song control nuclei in the forebrain.},

               suggest that songs are structured hierarchically, there is also
               evidence that they are driven by nonhierarchical, clock-like
               bursting in the premotor nucleus HVC (used as a proper name). In
               this study, we developed a semiautomated template-matching
               algorithm to identify repeated sequences of syllables and a
               modified dynamic time-warping algorithm to make fine-grained
               measurements of the temporal structure of song. We find that
               changes in song length are expressed across the song as a whole
               rather than resulting from an accumulation of independent
               variance during singing. Song length changes systematically over
               the course of a day and is related to the general level of bird
               activity as well as the presence of a female. The data also show
               patterns of variability that suggest distinct mechanisms
               underlying syllable and gap lengths: as tempo varies, syllables
               stretch and compress proportionally less than gaps, whereas
               syllable-syllable and gap-gap correlations are significantly
               stronger than syllable-gap correlations. There is also increased
               temporal variability at motif boundaries and especially strong
               positive correlations between the same syllables sung in
               different motifs. Finally, we find evidence that syllable onsets
               may have a special role in aligning syllables with global song
               structure. Generally, the timing data support a hierarchical view
               in which song is composed of smaller syllable-based units and

               precision and tight links with precisely timed bursting in
               forebrain neurons. To examine the development of song timing, we
               measured the following four aspects of song temporal structure at
               four age ranges between 65 and 375 days posthatch: the mean
               durations of song syllables and the silent gaps between them,
               timing variability linked to song tempo, timing variability
               expressed independently across syllables and gaps, and transition
               probabilities between consecutive syllable pairs. We found
               substantial increases in song tempo between 65 and 85 days
               posthatch, due almost entirely to a shortening of gaps. We also
               found a decrease in tempo variability, also specific to gaps.
               Both the magnitude of the increase in tempo and the decrease in
               tempo variability were correlated on gap-by-gap basis with
               increases in the reliability of corresponding syllable
               transitions. Syllables had no systematic increase in tempo or
               decrease in tempo variability. In contrast to tempo parameters,
               both syllables and gaps showed an early sharp reduction in
               independent variability followed by continued reductions over the
               first year. The data suggest that links between syllable-based
               representations are strengthened during the later parts of the
               traditional period of song learning and that song rhythm
               continues to become more regular throughout the first year of

               sequences, made up of multiple distinct acoustic units. Apart
               from the well-known example of birdsong, other animals such as
               insects, amphibians, and mammals (including bats, rodents,
               primates, and cetaceans) also generate complex acoustic
               sequences. Occasionally, such as with birdsong, the adaptive role
               of these sequences seems clear (e.g. mate attraction and
               territorial defence). More often however, researchers have only
               begun to characterise - let alone understand - the significance
               and meaning of acoustic sequences. Hypotheses abound, but there
               is little agreement as to how sequences should be defined and
               analysed. Our review aims to outline suitable methods for testing
               these hypotheses, and to describe the major limitations to our
               current and near-future knowledge on questions of acoustic
               sequences. This review and prospectus is the result of a
               collaborative effort between 43 scientists from the fields of
               animal behaviour, ecology and evolution, signal processing,
               machine learning, quantitative linguistics, and information
               theory, who gathered for a 2013 workshop entitled, 'Analysing

               review of the state of the art, but to propose a methodological
               framework that summarises what we suggest are the best practices
               for research in this field, across taxa and across disciplines.
               We also provide a tutorial-style introduction to some of the most
               promising algorithmic approaches for analysing sequences. We
               divide our review into three sections: identifying the distinct
               units of an acoustic sequence, describing the different ways that
               information can be contained within a sequence, and analysing the
               structure of that sequence. Each of these sections is further
               subdivided to address the key questions and approaches in that
               area. We propose a uniform, systematic, and comprehensive
               approach to studying sequences, with the goal of clarifying

               that the quality of one's speech is checked by the speech
               comprehension system. This system inspects one's own overt speech
               but would also inspect an inner speech plan (``the inner loop'').
               We have elaborated and tested this theory by way of formalizing
               it as a computational model. This model includes a new proposal
               concerning the timing relation between planning the interruption
               and the repair: the proposal that these two processes are
               performed in parallel. We attempted to simulate empirical data
               about the distribution of error-to-cutoff and cutoff-to-repair
               intervals and the effect of speech rate on these intervals (these
               intervals are shorter with faster speech). The main questions
               were (1) Is an inner monitor that utilizes the speech perception
               system fast enough to simulate the timing data? (2) Can the model
               account for the effects of speech rate on these intervals? We
               conclude that including an inner loop through the speech
               comprehension system generates predictions that fit the empirical
               data. The effects of speed can be accounted for, given our
               proposal about the time course of planning interruption and
               repair. A novel prediction is that the error-to-cutoff interval

               countermanding task, generalizes to all forms of stopping, this
               has never been tested. In the present study, stopping performance
               in the countermanding paradigm was compared with stopping
               performance in a new paradigm in which a continuous-tracking task
               was used. Although stimulus presentations were matched across
               paradigms, the two tasks differed in the type of stopping
               required. In the countermanding paradigm, response inhibition
               latency was measured prior to response execution-this is, it was
               inferred from the successful withholding of a go response. In the
               new paradigm, response inhibition was carried out after response
               execution-that is, it was measured as the time to begin stopping
               a continuous tracking response. Results indicated that stopping
               latencies between the two paradigms were highly correlated,
               providing strong evidence that stopping an unexecuted response
               engages the same mechanisms as stopping an ongoing response.},

               the processes of movement engagement and termination are
               dissociable, whether stopping an action is a generic process, and
               whether there is a point in time in which the generation of a
               planned action is inevitable (``point of no return''). It is not
               clear yet, however, whether the action of stopping is merely a
               manifestation of low level, dynamic constraints, or whether it is
               also subject to a high level, kinematic plan. In the present
               study, stopping performance was studied while nine subjects, who
               generated free scribbling movements looking for the location of
               an invisible circular target, were requested unexpectedly to
               impede movement. Temporal analysis of the data shows that in 87\%
               of the movements subsequent to the 'stop' cue, the tangential
               motion velocity profile was not a decelerating function of the
               time but rather exhibited a complex pattern comprised of one or
               more velocity peaks, implying an unstoppable motion element.
               Furthermore, geometrical analysis shows that the figural
               properties of the path generated after the 'stop' cue were part
               of a repetitive geometrical pattern and that the probability of
               completing a pattern after the 'stop' cue was correlated with the
               relative advance in the geometrical plan rather than the amount
               of time that had elapsed from the pattern initiation. Altogether,
               these findings suggest that the ``point of no return'' phenomenon

               a careful analysis of the timing of natural conversation reveals
               that next speakers also time their turns very precisely. This is
               possible only if listeners can predict accurately when the

               can be selected are assumed to be segments, i.e. consonants and
               vowels. The features or articulatory gestures affiliated with
               segments are presumed to be automatically selected as a

               past and only recently has inhibition earned its own place in the
               neurosciences as a fundamental cognitive function. In this review
               we first introduce the concept of inhibition from early
               psychological speculations based on philosophical theories of the
               human mind. The broad construct of inhibition is then reduced to
               its most readily observable component which necessarily is its
               behavioral manifestation. The study of `response inhibition' has
               the advantage of dealing with a relatively simple and
               straightforward process, the overriding of a planned or already
               initiated action. Deficient inhibitory processes profoundly
               affect everyday life, causing impulsive conduct which is
               generally detrimental for the individual. Impulsivity has been
               consistently linked to several types of addiction, attention
               deficit/hyperactivity disorder, mania and other psychiatric
               conditions. Our discussion of the behavioral assessment of

               inhibition that have been implemented in parallel for humans and

               infants' errors result from general processes that make
               goal-directed actions to remembered locations. Based on this
               account, the A-not-B error should be a general phenomenon,
               observable in different tasks and at different points in
               development. Smith, Thelen, et al.'s proposal was tested using an
               A-not-B version of a sandbox task. During three training trials
               and three ``A'' trials, 2-year-olds watched as a toy was buried
               in a sandbox at Location A. Following a 10-s delay, children
               searched for the object. Across five experiments, children's
               (total N = 92) performance on the A trials was accurate. After
               the A trials, children watched as a toy was hidden at Location B,
               8 to 10 inches from Location A. In all experiments, children's
               searches after a 10-s delay were significantly biased in the

	abstract = {In a prescient paper Karl Lashley (1951) rejected reflex chaining
               accounts of the sequencing of behavior and argued instead for a
               more cognitive account in which behavioral sequences are
               typically controlled with central plans. An important feature of
               such plans, according to Lashley, is that they are hierarchical.
               Lashley offered several sources of evidence for the hierarchical
               organization for behavioral plans, and others afterward provided
               more evidence for this hypothesis. We briefly review that
               evidence here and then shift from a focus on the structure of
               plans (Lashley's point of concentration) to the processes by
               which plans are formed in real time. Two principles emerge from
               the studies we review. One is that plans are not formed from
               scratch for each successive movement sequence but instead are
               formed by making whatever changes are needed to distinguish the
               movement sequence to be performed next from the movement sequence
               that has just been performed. This plan-modification view is
               supported by two phenomena discovered in our laboratory: the
               parameter remapping effect, and the handpath priming effect. The
               other principle we review is that even single movements appear to
               be controlled with hierarchically organized plans. At the top
               level are the starting and goal postures. At the lower level are
               the intermediate states comprising the transition from the
               starting posture to the goal posture. The latter principle is
               supported by another phenomenon discovered in our lab, the
               end-state comfort effect, and by a computational model of motor
               planning which accounts for a large number of motor phenomena.
               Interestingly, the computational model hearkens back to a
               classical method of generating cartoon animations that relies on
               the production of keyframes first and the production of
               interframes (intermediate frames) second.},

               in these areas often assumes a single underlying semantic network
               that is shared across individuals. Yet, recent evidence suggests
               that content, size, and connectivity of semantic networks are
               experience-dependent, implying sizable individual and age-related
               differences. Here, we investigate individual and age differences
               in the semantic networks of younger and older adults by deriving
               semantic networks from both fluency and similarity rating tasks.
               Crucially, we use a megastudy approach to obtain thousands of
               similarity ratings per individual to allow us to capture the
               characteristics of individual semantic networks. We find that
               older adults possess lexical networks with smaller average degree
               and longer path lengths relative to those of younger adults, with
               older adults showing less interindividual agreement and thus more
               unique lexical representations relative to younger adults.
               Furthermore, this approach shows that individual and age
               differences are not evenly distributed but, rather, are related
               to weakly connected, peripheral parts of the networks. All in

               regarding the effects of valence and arousal in visual word

               differences as one of the possible explanations for these
               inconsistencies. The main aim of the present research was to
               examine whether participants' individual differences in the level
               of epistemically unwarranted beliefs (EUB) contribute to these
               conflicting results. Therefore, participants who varied in their
               level of paranormal, pseudoscientific and conspiracy beliefs
               (assessed by self-report measures) performed a lexical decision
               task (LDT) and a recognition memory task. Linear mixed-effects
               models over LDT response times revealed that the effects of
               words' emotional content (both valence and arousal) were
               modulated by the degree of individuals' EUB. In addition, signal
               detection theory analyses showed that in the recognition task
               (but not in the LDT) response bias became more liberal as
               individuals' EUB increased. These patterns of effects were not
               general to all EUB instances. The obtained results highlight the
               need to consider participants' individual differences in
               affective word processing and signal detection. In addition, this
               study reveals some basic psychological mechanisms that would

	abstract = {Repeating a response from the previous trial typically leads to
               performance benefits. However, these benefits are eliminated, and
               usually reversed, when switching to a new task (i.e.,
               response-repetition costs). Here, we test the proposal that
               response-repetition costs reflect changes in the representation
               of an action. To investigate this, we designed tasks that
               required participants to switch between color and shape judgments
               with experimentally induced outcomes. Critically, the stimuli and
               responses were constant across conditions; what differed was the
               number of outcomes associated with the responses. For both
               response time and error rate, response-repetition costs on
               task-switch trials were significantly reduced when response
               repetitions led to outcome repetitions relative to when response
               repetitions led to outcome switches. Moreover, response
               repetitions that led to outcome repetitions showed an advantage
               in response time (but not error rate) compared with when no
               outcomes were experimentally induced. We conclude that
               response-repetition costs reflect a change in the representation

               gesture production benefits most, and whether certain types of
               gestures are more beneficial than others. This study, therefore,
               investigated the effect of gesture production during the encoding
               of a narrative on subsequent narrative recall, and whether
               individuals' levels of verbal and nonverbal memory moderated this
               effect. Additionally, this study investigated whether producing
               certain types of gestures during encoding was more beneficial
               than others. Participants (N = 90, Mage = 20.43) read aloud a
               narrative while under instruction to produce gestures, under no
               specific instruction to produce gestures, or were required to

	abstract = {Human languages can express an infinite number of thoughts
               despite having a finite set of words and rules. This is due, in
               part, to recursive structures, which allow us to embed one
               instance of a rule inside another. We investigated the origins of
               recursion by studying the development of Nicaraguan Sign Language
               (LSN), which emerged in the last 40 years and is not derived from
               any existing language. Before this, deaf individuals in Nicaragua
               lacked access to language models and each individual created
               their own gestural system, called homesign. We tested four
               groups: homesigners, who represent the point of origin, and the
               first three generations of LSN signers, who represent consecutive
               stages in the language's development. We used a task that was
               designed to elicit sentences with relative clauses, a device that
               allows for the recursive embedding of sentences inside of
               sentences (e.g., [the girl [who was drawing] removed the
               picture]). Signers in all three LSN cohorts consistently produced
               utterances that appeared to have embedded predicates (girl draw
               remove picture) which served the function of a relative clause
               (picking out the correct member of a set, based on previously
               mentioned information). Furthermore, in these utterances, the
               first verb was shorter than the second and shorter than the same
               verb in parallel unembedded structures. In contrast, homesigners
               produced similar utterances in embedded and unembedded contexts.
               They did not reintroduce previously mentioned information or
               produce reduced verb forms in the embedded context. These results
               demonstrate that syntactic embedding that is potentially
               recursive can emerge very early in a language. These embedded
               predicates, however, may not be widespread, or systematically
               marked, in homesign systems. This raises the possibility that the
               emergence of recursive linguistic structure is a consequence of
               interaction within a language community. These findings pave the
               way for future work which investigates the syntactic form of
               these embedded predicates and explores whether multiple levels of
               embedding are possible.},

                   result of a learned ability to maintain implicit

              motor performance suffers when responses in a repeated sequence

              production, repeated recitation of the beginning of the alphabet
              is slowed dramatically if the same letters have different stress
              levels on successive cycles; the same effect holds for
              vowel-consonant relationships. In keyboard performance,
              repetitions of fingertapping sequences suffer if the number of
              consecutive taps by the same finger changes from cycle to cycle;
              we call these difficult sequences finger fumblers. Finally,
              similar effects are obtained with violin playing. The model we
              develop to account for these results says that parameter values
              mapped to the subprogram for a response item persist after the
              subprogram has been executed, and that extra processing is
              required if a new parameter value must be mapped to the subprogram

              the view that motor programs for forthcoming actions are prepared
              by editing motor programs for actions that have just been
              completed. Because our results are similar to interference effects

                   minimal sentence pairs in Mandarin Chinese grouped into 9
                   high-level linguistic phenomena. Each pair demonstrates the

                   phenomenon (e.g., The keys are lost vs. The keys is lost),
                   and an LM should assign lower perplexity to the acceptable

                   created by translating the vocabulary of the English BLiMP

               cross-linguistic universal reflecting syntactic complexity in
               natural languages. A typical way to operationalize dependency
               length in corpus-based studies has been to count the number of
               words between syntactically related words. However, such a
               formulation ignores the syntactic nature of the linguistic
               material that intervenes a dependency. In this work, we
               investigate if the number of syntactic heads (rather than the
               number of words) that intervene a dependency better captures the
               syntactic complexity across languages. We demonstrate that the
               dependency length minimization constraint in terms of the number
               of words could arise as a consequence of constraints on the
               intervening heads and the tree properties such as node arity. The

	abstract = {Music listening often entails spontaneous perception and body
              movement to a periodic pulse-like meter. There is increasing
              evidence that this cross-cultural ability relates to neural
              processes that selectively enhance metric periodicities, even when
              these periodicities are not prominent in the acoustic stimulus.
              However, whether these neural processes emerge early in
              development remains largely unknown. Here, we recorded the
              electroencephalogram (EEG) of 20 healthy 5- to 6-month-old
              infants, while they were exposed to two rhythms known to induce
              perception of meter consistently across Western adults. One rhythm
              contained prominent acoustic periodicities corresponding to the
              meter, whereas the other rhythm did not. Infants showed
              significantly enhanced representations of meter periodicities in
              their EEG responses to both rhythms. This effect is unlikely to
              reflect the tracking of salient acoustic features in the stimulus,
              as it was observed irrespective of the prominence of meter
              periodicities in the audio signals. Moreover, as previously
              observed in adults, the neural enhancement of meter was greater
              when the rhythm was delivered by low-pitched sounds. Together,
              these findings indicate that the endogenous enhancement of metric
              periodicities beyond low-level acoustic features is a neural
              property that is already present soon after birth. These

              long-standing view in language production research is that this
              structural priming is driven by the persistence of abstract
              syntax, independent from unordered, conceptual representations.
              However, evidence has been building that non-syntactic information
              can also influence structural choice. Here we examined whether and
              how the syntactic priming of relative clause structures might
              interact with the priming of the conceptual category order of
              adjectives in noun phrase production. Study 1 found that speakers
              are more likely to produce relative clause structures (spotted bow
              that's green) after having heard relative clause structures
              (striped lock that's blue) as opposed to an alternative structure
              (striped blue lock), and they also tended to repeat the conceptual
              order of the prime, with more pattern-first orders after
              pattern-first primes than after color-first primes. Critically, we
              found larger syntactic priming when the conceptual order of the
              prime persisted more in the target and larger conceptual order
              priming when the syntactic structure of the prime persisted more
              in the target. Studies 2 and 3 found that conceptual category
              order priming can be enhanced by adjective overlap as well as noun
              overlap between prime and target, whereas syntactic priming can
              only be enhanced by noun overlap. These results supported the
              interactive priming account: Although the syntactic structure and
              the conceptual order are represented at different levels and hence
              can be activated independently, the link between them is also
              primed, which enhances priming at both levels.},

               that a filled gap would elicit a prediction error brain signal in
               the form of an early anterior negativity, as we have previously
               observed in adults. We found an early (bilateral) anterior
               negativity to the filled gap in a control group of children with
               Typical Development (TD), but the children with DLD exhibited no
               brain response to the filled gap during the same early time
               window. This suggests that children with DLD fail to predict that
               a relativized object should correspond to an empty position after
               the relative clause verb, suggesting an impairment in predictive
               processing. We discuss how this lack of a prediction error signal
               can interact with language acquisition and result in DLD.},

              young children's speech segments tend to be longer and more

              little longitudinal information of this nature is available that
              considers changes across time for individual children. The present
              investigation is a longitudinal analysis of several temporal
              characteristics of the speech of 12 children of various ages who
              were each seen twice, approximately 1 1/2 years apart. For the
              group, durations decreased on average from the initial to the
              follow-up recordings by approximately 10\%, and temporal
              variability decreased by about 40\%. For the individual children,
              however, it was found that some of them showed few, if any,
              changes in some of the temporal measurements made at the two
              different times, whereas others showed substantial differences.
              Younger children also did not necessarily show longer durations or
              greater variability than older children, nor did younger children
              always show greater changes across time than older children. Thus,
              although cross-sectional studies indicate that there is a general
              tendency when comparing groups for increased age to be associated
              with shorter durations and reduced variability, individual

               abstract priming, yet readily observable lexically-mediated
               priming. These observations spurred important questions about
               whether structural processing is more lexically dependent during

               predict this difficulty can be broadly divided into two kinds,
               expectation-based and memory-based. In this work, we present a
               new model of incremental sentence processing difficulty that
               unifies and extends key features of both kinds of models. Our
               model, lossy-context surprisal, holds that the processing

               of the word given a lossy memory representation of the

              revealed that language production, similar to non-verbal tasks,

              decreased congruency effect following incongruent trials. Although
              CSE is considered an index of adaptive control, its mechanism is
              debated. In two experiments, we tested the predictions of a
              learning model of adaptive control in production, using a
              task-switching paradigm fully balanced to evaluate CSE on a PWI
              trial as a function of the congruency of a 2-back PWI trial
              (within-task CSE), as well as a 1-back trial belonging to a
              different task (cross-task CSE). The second task was a
              visuospatial task with congruent and incongruent trials in
              Experiment 1, and a self-paced reading task with ambiguous and
              unambiguous sentences in Experiment 2 that imposed a gap between
              the two PWI trials twice as long of that in Experiment 1. A
              learning model posits that CSE is the result of changes to the
              connection weights between task-specific representations and a
              control center, which leads to two predictions in our paradigm:
              (a) a robust within-task CSE unaffected by the intervening trial
              and the gap duration, and (b) an absent or reversed cross-task
              CSE. These predictions were contrasted with two versions of an

              within-task CSE was also found in the visuospatial and sentence
              reading tasks. On the other hand, examination of cross-task CSE
              from PWI to the other tasks and vice versa revealed either absent

               1,884 utterances that were coded for lexical, grammatical, and

               the tendency for the onsets of words to slip more frequently than
               segments at other word positions. Some researchers attribute this
               effect to the phonological properties of word onsets, while
               others suggest it reflects something specific about the role
               played by the word onset during phonological recovery and/or
               sequencing. The study reported here examined these two
               possibilities using a tongue-twister paradigm in which subjects
               were asked to repeatedly recite a visually-presented word
               quadruple. The lexical status of the words in target sequences
               was manipulated independently of their broader phonological
               characteristics (overall sonority profile and consonant
               composition) by simply altering their constituent vowels (e.g.
               case port bed moon vs. koss pait bod marn). Errors elicited on

               effect; this effect was entirely confined to between-word

               onset effect, either overall or on between-word errors considered

               be entirely attributed to phonological factors, but instead
               reflects something about the larger role word onsets play in
               (real word) speech planning. A new account is offered, which

              neighborhood density (e.g., Luce \& Pisoni, 1998) by assuming that
              not all phonological neighbors are equal. Rather, it is assumed
              that the phonological lexicon has psycholinguistic structure.
              Accordingly, in addition to considering the number of phonological
              neighbors for any given word, it becomes important to consider the
              nature of these neighbors. If one type of neighbor is more

              segmental representation other than the phoneme, particularly
              prior to literacy. Statistical analyses of the nature of
              phonological neighborhoods in terms of rime neighbors (e.g.,
              hat/cat), consonant neighbors (e.g., hat/hit), and lead neighbors

              memorization may affect the fluency of concurrently repeated
              words. The words silently read or memorized were phonologically
              similar or dissimilar to the words of the repetition task.
              Fourteen adults who stutter and 16 who do not participated in the
              experiment. The two groups were matched for age, education, sex,
              forward and backward memory span and vocabulary. It was found that
              the disfluencies of persons who stutter significantly increased
              during word repetition when similar words were read or memorized
              concurrently. In contrast, the disfluencies of persons who do not
              stutter were not significantly affected by either secondary task.
              These results indicate that the speech of persons who stutter is
              more sensitive to interference from concurrently performed
              cognitive processing than that of nonstuttering persons. It is
              proposed that the phonological and articulatory systems of persons
              who stutter are protected less efficiently from interference by
              attention-demanding processing within the central executive
              system. Alternative interpretations are also discussed.
              EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES: Readers will learn how modern speech
              production theories and the concept of modularity can account for
              stuttering, and will be able to explain the greater vulnerability
              of stutterer's speech fluency to concurrent cognitive processing.},

              response-stimulus intervals bilinguals have smaller sequential
              congruency effects in flanker tasks compared to monolinguals. They
              interpret these differences to mean that bilinguals are more
              efficient at disengaging attentional control. Ten empirical
              studies are presented that show no differences between bilinguals
              and monolinguals under conditions that produced robust sequential
              congruency effects. These null results are discussed with respect
              to the rate at which sequential congruency effects dissipate and
              the fact these effects are not adaptive in the sense of improving
              overall performance. Arguments made by Goldsmith and Morton [1]
              that smaller sequential congruency effects should not be
              interpreted as ``advantages'' are extended. Evidence is also
              presented that neither simple congruency effects, nor sequential

              particular deficits in the generation of sequenced action: the
              quintessential procedural task. Practiced imitation of a sequence
              may become rote and require reduced procedural memory. This study
              explored whether speech motor deficits in children with SLI occur
              generally or only in conditions of high linguistic load, whether
              speech motor deficits diminish with practice, and whether it is
              beneficial to incorporate conditions of high load to understand
              speech production. Method: Children with SLI and typical
              development participated in a syntactic priming task during which
              they generated sentences (high linguistic load) and, then,
              practiced repeating a sentence (low load) across 3 sessions. We
              assessed phonetic accuracy, speech movement variability, and
              duration. Results: Children with SLI produced more variable
              articulatory movements than peers with typical development in the
              high load condition. The groups converged in the low load
              condition. Children with SLI continued to show increased

              locus of the control processes involved in selection (selection
              control) and intercepting errors (post-monitoring control).
              Selection control was studied by manipulating the overlap
              (contextual similarity) in either semantics or in segments between
              two objects that participants repeatedly named. Post-monitoring
              control was examined by asking participants to reverse, within
              each block, the name of the two objects that were either
              semantically- or segmentally-related, thus suppressing a potent,
              but incorrect, response in favor of an alternative (reversal).
              Results showed robust costs of both contextual similarity (which
              increased with the degree of similarity between target and
              context) and reversal, but the two did not interact with one

              lexical selection; producers could refer to an animal as

              psycholinguistic research is how and why producers make the
              lexical selections that they do. Information theoretic approaches
              have argued that producers regulate the uncertainty of the
              utterance for comprehenders, for example using longer words like
              chimpanzee if their messages are likely to be misunderstood, and
              shorter ones like chimp when the message is easy to understand. In
              this work, we test for the relative contributions of the
              information theoretic approach and an approach more aligned with
              psycholinguistic models of language production. We examine the

              approach, we show that for both naturalistic stimuli and
              real-world corpora, producers prefer words to be longer in
              systematically different contexts, independent of the specific
              message they are trying to convey. We do not find evidence for
              regulation of uncertainty, as in information theoretic approaches.

	abstract = {Rhythmic structure in speech is characterized by sequences of
              stressed and unstressed syllables. A large body of literature
              suggests that speakers of English attempt to achieve rhythmic
              harmony by evenly distributing stressed syllables throughout
              prosodic phrases. The question remains as to how speakers plan
              metrical structure during speech production and whether it is
              planned independently of phonemes. To examine this, we designed a
              tongue twister task consisting of disyllabic word pairs with
              overlapping phonological segments and either matching or
              non-matching metrical structure. Results showed that speakers had
              more difficulty producing metrically regular word pairs, compared
              to irregular pairs; that is, word pairs with irregular meter had
              faster productions and fewer speech errors in this production
              task. This finding of metrical regularity inhibiting production is
              inconsistent with an abstract metrical structure that is planned
              independently of phonemes at the point of phonological encoding.},

              pictures with disyllabic names in small sets and blocks, with the
              critical manipulation whether pictures within a block shared an
              atonal syllable or not. We found the expected facilitation when
              the overlapping portion of responses was in word-initial position,
              but we also replicated a recent observation that with
              'inconsistent' overlap (shared syllables could be either in first
              or second word position), form overlap causes interference.
              Crucially, interference also occurred when phonologically
              unrelated filler trials or trials which required a nonlinguistic
              response were interleaved with the critical pictures. The same
              pattern was found with written responses and orthographic radical
              overlap. The results are best explained via ``competitive
              incremental learning'' between lexical and phonological
              representations. A computer simulation confirms that this
              principle generates interference, and that the result is
              unaffected by filler trials. We conclude that incremental learning

	abstract = {The ability to retain an action plan to execute another is
              necessary for most complex, goal-directed behavior. Research shows
              that executing an action plan to an interrupting event can be
              delayed when it partly overlaps (vs. does not overlap) with the
              retained action plan. This phenomenon is known as partial
              repetition costs (PRCs). PRCs reflect proactive interference,
              which may be resolved by inhibitory, executive control processes.
              We investigated whether these inhibitory processes are compromised
              due to one night of sleep deprivation. Participants were
              randomized to a sleep-deprived group or a well-rested control
              group. All participants performed an action planning task at
              baseline after a full night of sleep, and again either after a
              night of sleep deprivation (sleep-deprived group) or a full night
              of sleep (control group). In this task, two visual events occurred
              in a sequence. Participants retained an action plan to the first
              event in working memory while executing a speeded action to the
              second (interrupting) event; afterwards, they executed the action
              to the first event. The two action plans either partly overlapped
              (required the same hand) or did not (required different hands).
              Results showed slower responses to the interrupting event during
              sleep deprivation compared to baseline and the control group.
              However, the magnitude of the PRCs was no different during sleep
              deprivation compared to baseline and the control group. Thus, one
              night of sleep deprivation slowed global responses to the
              interruption, but inhibitory processes involved in reducing
              proactive interference while responding to an interrupting event
              were not compromised. These findings are consistent with other
              studies that show sleep deprivation degrades global task
              performance, but does not necessarily degrade performance on
              isolated, executive control components of cognition. The
              possibility that our findings involve local as opposed to central
              inhibition is also discussed.},

              mechanisms that underlie how it is planned. Traditional models of
              language production assume that metrical and segmental planning
              occur independently and in parallel (Roelofs \& Meyer Learning
              Memory and Cognition, 24(4), 922-939, 1998). We test this claim in
              two experiments. In Experiment 1, participants completed an
              event-description task in which a disyllabic target word shared
              segmental overlap with a prime that either had matching or
              nonmatching lexical stress. Participants lengthened words in
              trials with both segmental and metrical overlap, which could
              either be the result of metrical interference or having uttered a
              prime with similar segmental realizations. To adjudicate between
              these possibilities, Experiment 2 included segmentally distinct
              word pairs with either matching or nonmatching stress.
              Participants again showed lengthening in trials with both
              segmental and metrical overlap, but no lengthening from metrical
              overlap alone. These data suggest that the acoustic-phonetic
              similarity of the initial syllables of the prime and target
              creates competition that leads to word lengthening. These are
              consistent with production models in which segmental and metrical

              rhythm, in which stressed and unstressed syllables alternate. In
              previous research regular, alternating patterns have been shown to
              facilitate online language comprehension. Expanding these findings
              to downstream processing would lead to the prediction that

              We propose that processes known to play a role in individual
              nonroutine actions might contribute to the control of nonroutine
              sequential action, as well. In particular, binding between
              simultaneously occurring stimuli and responses (SR-binding) has
              been discussed as one basic process in action control (Henson,
              Eckstein, Waszak, Frings, \& Horner, 2014). All binding related
              studies up to this point focused on very short events, including a
              maximum of two directly contiguous responses. By contrast, most
              elements in sequential actions share no point of direct contact.
              In three experiments we analyzed the structure of bindings in
              sequences of two and three responses and found identical bindings
              between contiguous and noncontiguous responses. This pattern

               have made extensive use of it to illuminate psychological
               functioning. In the language sciences, a ubiquitous form of such
               repetition is structural priming, a tendency to repeat or better
               process a current sentence because of its structural similarity
               to a previously experienced (``prime'') sentence (J. K. Bock,
               1986). The recent explosion of research in structural priming has
               made it the dominant means of investigating the processes
               involved in the production (and increasingly, comprehension) of
               complex expressions such as sentences. This review considers its
               implications for the representation of syntax and the mechanisms
               of production and comprehension and their relationship. It then
               addresses the potential functions of structural priming, before
               turning to its implications for first language acquisition,
               bilingualism, and aphasia. The authors close with theoretical and

               their release as speech motor acts. Using a finite alphabet of
               learned phonemes and a relatively small number of syllable
               structures, speakers are able to rapidly plan and produce
               arbitrary syllable sequences that fall within the rules of their

               neural representations underlie serial action, and this idea is
               increasingly supported by experimental evidence. In this article,
               we developed a neural model that extends the existing DIVA model
               of speech production in two complementary ways. The new model
               includes paired structure and content subsystems [cf. MacNeilage,
               P. F. The frame/content theory of evolution of speech production.

               mechanisms for interfacing these phonological planning
               representations with learned sensorimotor programs to enable
               stepping through multisyllabic speech plans. On the basis of
               previous reports, the model's components are hypothesized to be
               localized to specific cortical and subcortical structures,
               including the left inferior frontal sulcus, the medial premotor
               cortex, the basal ganglia, and the thalamus. The new model,
               called gradient order DIVA, thus fills a void in current speech
               research by providing formal mechanistic hypotheses about both
               phonological and phonetic processes that are grounded by
               neuroanatomy and physiology. This framework also generates

	abstract = {A sentence-pair repetition procedure was used to examine how
               inflected and derived words are represented during speech
               planning. Three experiments tested the hypotheses that
               inflectional structure is represented in syntactic plans for
               speech, and that derivational structure is not, as assumed by
               speech production theories. Participants performed aloud
               repetitions of pairs of sentences that matched in all structural
               aspects (Congruent) or differed in the morphological affixation
               of one critical word (Incongruent). In the Syntactically Engaged
               condition, the critical words filled their usual syntactic roles.
               In the Syntactically Disengaged condition, the critical words
               were merely cited (e.g., Say $\underline{walked}$ first.), so
               they should not affect the syntactic plan. Production theories
               predict that repetition of sentences with incongruent inflections
               should be more difficult than repetition of sentences with
               congruent inflections, especially in the Syntactically Engaged
               condition. For derivational morphology, the theories stipulate no
               syntactic engagement of affixes, but a separate phonological
               competition process may produce a general congruence cost for
               these materials. Experiment 1 studied inflectional morphology
               using a discrete repetition task, in which participants performed
               isolated repetitions of sentence pairs. Production durations
               showed an effect of Congruence but no interaction with Syntactic
               Engagement, suggesting that the task may be insufficiently
               sensitive to syntactic planning processes. Accordingly,
               Experiments 2 and 3 adopted the continuous repetition procedure
               employed in previous production planning research to examine
               inflectional and derivational morphology, respectively. Overall,
               results confirmed predictions and supported the hypotheses that
               inflectional structure is represented in syntactic plans, and
               that derivational structure is not. In addition, the experiments
               demonstrate that the continuous repetition task can be applied
               successfully to study syntactic and morphological planning,
               opening the door for experiments addressing finer details of the

              cognitive constraints limiting the speed and ease of language
              comprehension and production. Wide-ranging evidence demonstrates a
              key role for linguistic expectations: A word's predictability, as
              measured by the information-theoretic quantity of surprisal, is a
              major determinant of processing difficulty. But surprisal, under
              standard theories, fails to predict the difficulty profile of an
              important class of linguistic patterns: the nested hierarchical
              structures made possible by recursion in human language. These
              nested structures are better accounted for by psycholinguistic
              theories of constrained working memory capacity. However, progress
              on theory unifying expectation-based and memory-based accounts has
              been limited. Here we present a unified theory of a rational
              trade-off between precision of memory representations with ease of
              prediction, a scaled-up computational implementation using
              contemporary machine learning methods, and experimental evidence

              the theory makes nuanced and distinctive predictions for
              difficulty patterns in nested recursive structures predicted by
              neither expectation-based nor memory-based theories alone. These

@article{Van_de_Cavey2016-hl,
	abstract = {Cognitive processing in many domains (e.g., sentence
              comprehension, music listening, and math solving) requires
              sequential information to be organized into an integrational
              structure. There appears to be some overlap in integrational
              processing across domains, as shown by cross-domain interference
              effects when for example linguistic and musical stimuli are
              jointly presented (Koelsch, Gunter, Wittfoth, \& Sammler, 2005;
              Slevc, Rosenberg, \& Patel, 2009). These findings support theories
              of overlapping resources for integrational processing across
              domains (cfr. SSIRH Patel, 2003; SWM, Kljajevic, 2010). However,
              there are some limitations to the studies mentioned above, such as
              the frequent use of unnaturalistic integrational difficulties. In
              recent years, the idea has risen that evidence for
              domain-generality in structural processing might also be yielded
              though priming paradigms (cfr. Scheepers, 2003). The rationale
              behind this is that integrational processing across domains
              regularly requires the processing of dependencies across short or
              long distances in the sequence, involving respectively less or
              more syntactic working memory resources (cfr. SWM, Kljajevic,
              2010), and such processing decisions might persist over time.
              However, whereas recent studies have shown suggestive priming of
              integrational structure between language and arithmetics (though
              often dependent on arithmetic performance, cfr. Scheepers et al.,
              2011; Scheepers \& Sturt, 2014), it remains to be investigated to
              what extent we can also find evidence for priming in other
              domains, such as music and action (cfr. SWM, Kljajevic, 2010).
              Experiment 1a showed structural priming from the processing of
              musical sequences onto the position in the sentence structure
              (early or late) to which a relative clause was attached in
              subsequent sentence completion. Importantly, Experiment 1b showed
              that a similar structural manipulation based on non-hierarchically
              ordered color sequences did not yield any priming effect,
              suggesting that the priming effect is not based on linear order,
              but integrational dependency. Finally, Experiment 2 presented
              primes in four domains (relative clause sentences, music,
              mathematics, and structured descriptions of actions), and
              consistently showed priming within and across domains. These
              findings provide clear evidence for domain-general structural
              processing mechanisms.},

              in the field is a positive development, but many recent studies

              recalibration). Theoretically, for a half century there has been a
              recurring effort to demonstrate the psychological reality of
              various linguistic units, such as the phoneme or the allophone.
              The evidence is that listeners will use essentially any pattern
              that has been experienced often enough, not just the units that
              are well-suited to linguistic descriptions of language. Thus,
              rather than trying to identify any special perceptual status for
              linguistic units, psycholinguists should focus their efforts on
              more productive issues.},

              current environment. If such adaptation is rational or
              near-rational, the extent to which speakers adapt their

              error is sensitive to both prior and recent experience within the

              purpose. Yet in everyday life physical actions are usually carried
              out for higher-order goals. We asked whether two previously
              discovered motor planning phenomena--the end-state comfort effect
              and motor hysteresis--would hold up if the actions were carried
              out in the service of higher-order goals. The higher-order goal we
              chose to study was memorization. By focusing on memorization, we
              asked not only how and whether motor planning is affected by the
              need to memorize, but also how memory performance might depend on
              the cognitive demands of motor planning. We asked
              university-student participants to retrieve cups from a column of
              drawers and memorize as many letters as possible from the inside
              of the cups. The drawers were opened either in a random order
              (Experiment 1) or in a regular order (Experiments 2 and 3). The
              end-state comfort effect and motor hysteresis were replicated in
              these conditions, indicating that the effects hold up when
              physical actions are carried out for the sake of a higher-order
              goal. Surprisingly, one of the most reliable effects in memory
              research was eliminated, namely, the tendency of recent items to
              be recalled better than earlier items--the recency effect. This
              outcome was not an artifact of memory being uniformly poor,
              because the tendency of initial items to be recalled better than
              later items--the primacy effect--was obtained. Elimination of the
              recency effect was not due to the requirement that participants

              also eliminated when the items could be recalled in any order

              order in action planning, the
              Production-Distribution-Comprehension (PDC) account links work in
              the fields of language production, typology, and comprehension:
              (1) faced with substantial computational burdens of planning and
              producing utterances, language producers implicitly follow three
              biases in utterance planning that promote word order choices that
              reduce these burdens, thereby improving production fluency. (2)
              These choices, repeated over many utterances and individuals,
              shape the distributions of utterance forms in language. The claim
              that language form stems in large degree from producers' attempts
              to mitigate utterance planning difficulty is contrasted with
              alternative accounts in which form is driven by language use more
              broadly, language acquisition processes, or producers' attempts to
              create language forms that are easily understood by comprehenders.
              (3) Language perceivers implicitly learn the statistical
              regularities in their linguistic input, and they use this prior
              experience to guide comprehension of subsequent language. In
              particular, they learn to predict the sequential structure of
              linguistic signals, based on the statistics of
              previously-encountered input. Thus, key aspects of comprehension
              behavior are tied to lexico-syntactic statistics in the language,
              which in turn derive from utterance planning biases promoting
              production of comparatively easy utterance forms over more
              difficult ones. This approach contrasts with classic theories in
              which comprehension behaviors are attributed to innate design
              features of the language comprehension system and associated
              working memory. The PDC instead links basic features of
              comprehension to a different source: production processes that
              shape language form.},

              the procedure was identical except that children did not repeat
              the experimenter's sentence. Priming effects were comparable to
              those in Study 1. In Study 3, after hearing the experimenter's

              demonstrated the inadequacy of then-standard models of associative
              chaining, positing a more flexible and generalized ``syntax of
              action'' necessary to encompass key aspects of language and music.
              He suggested that hierarchy in language and music builds upon a
              more basic sequential action system, and provided several concrete
              hypotheses about the nature of this system. Here, we review a

              computational function of the lateral prefrontal regions in action
              syntax remains debated, Lashley's notion-that this cortical region
              implements a working-memory buffer or stack scannable by posterior

              way that allows joints to be in mid-range at the end of the
              transport. When participants in the present study took hold of a
              vertical cylinder to move it to a new position, grasp heights on
              the cylinder were inversely related to the height of the target
              position, as predicted by the end-state comfort effect. This
              demonstrates that where people grasp objects can give insight into
              the planning of movement. In the computational model of motor
              planning developed by Rosenbaum et al. (1995, 2001) it is assumed
              that goal postures are planned by a two-stage process of recall
              and generation. The distinction between recall and generation had
              not so far been tested. In the present study, the pattern of grasp
              heights in successive transports was consistent with the view that
              participants generated a plan the first time they moved the
              cylinder between two points, and that they subsequently recalled
              what they had done before, making small adjustments to that

              theories of language performance were examined with a syntactic
              priming procedure. On each priming trial, subjects produced a
              priming sentence in one of several syntactic forms. They then
              viewed an unrelated event in a picture and described it in one
              sentence. The probability of a particular syntactic form being
              used in the description increased when that form had occurred in
              the prime, under presentation conditions that minimized subjects'
              attention to their speech, to the syntactic features of the
              priming sentences, and to connections between the priming
              sentences and the subsequent pictures. This syntactic repetition

              inertial and subject to such probabilistic factors as the
              frequency or recency of use of particular structural forms. Two
              further experiments showed that this effect was not appreciably
              modified by variations in certain conceptual characteristics of

               by subjective contemporaneousness, frequency, acceptability, and
               other lexical and structural characteristics of words. We

               pressure, using Spanish clitic-doubled left dislocation (CLLD) as
               a test case. The original version of the Interface Hypothesis
               (IH) predicts that L2 competence on syntax-discourse interface
               structures may diverge from that of L1 speakers , yet there is
               experimental evidence of native-like offline judgments of
               clitic-doubling and its correlation to relevant discourse
               contexts in L2 Spanish. However, the most updated version of the
               IH argues that problems at the syntax-discourse interface are not
               due to divergent competence but rather to L2 processing
               limitations. To isolate the potential source of divergence, in
               the present study L2 Spanish learners completed an Acceptability
               Judgment Task (low processing pressure) and a Speeded Production
               Task (high processing pressure). Group results show convergence
               on the native-like pattern on the Acceptability Judgment Task and

               correlated with L2 divergence, as predicted by the new version of

	abstract = {This thesis investigated the relationship between complex phrase
               comprehension and production. The work aimed to identify whether
               parallel competition effects exist between the two tasks; and
               importantly, the extent to which these effects drive from common
               processes and knowledge bases. In three studies, participants
               viewed pictures of various entities doing different actions. For
               each picture, they comprehended a recorded description (e.g. the
               teddy bear/man that the girl is hugging) about the entity being
               acted upon, and were asked to describe it in a production task.
               They also completed a number of cognitive assessments measuring
               vocabulary, inhibition, etc. Study 1 found that phrases
               containing highly similar and reversible nouns are more difficult
               to comprehend and produce in adults. Importantly, this difficulty
               varied as a function of individual inhibition skills over above
               vocabulary in both tasks, and production additionally recruited
               task-specific motor inhibition processes. Study 2 replicated the
               reversibility-based effects with children and adolescents. But
               young children differed from older participants as they
               experienced greater production interference and are less skilled
               in using certain production options to alleviate interference.
               Unlike adults, their language performance was predicted by
               variance on working memory capacity. Study 3 used eye-tracking to
               examine the time course of production competition. The results
               showed reversibility-based competition manifest at verb position,
               and is particularly relevant to individual's semantic inhibition
               skill. This parallels previous comprehension findings, thus
               suggests shared competition resolution processes across tasks.
               Together, these findings suggest common reversibility-based
               competition processes underlying comprehension and production,
               and across development. Current models arguing for shared
               prediction processes in adults can potentially incorporate common
               inhibition mechanisms; however, our data imply that non-shared
               processes should also be considered. On the other hand, unlike
               adults, our children's data supports the capacity-constraint
               account in language processing, thus suggesting a discontinuity
               of cognitive functioning in language development.},

	abstract = {Planning in complex domains is normally a resource and time
               consuming process when it is purely based on first principles.
               Once a plan is generated it represents problem solving knowledge.
               It implicitly describes knowledge used by the planning system to
               achieve a given goal state from a particular initial state. In
               classical planning systems, this knowledge is often lost after
               the plan has been successfully executed. If such a planner has to
               solve the same problem again, it will spend the same planning
               effort to solve it and is not capable of ``learning'; from its
               ''experience';. Therefore it seems to be useful to save generated
               plans for a later reuse and thus, extending the problem solving
               knowledge possessed by the planner. The planning knowledge can
               now be applied to find out whether a problem can be solved by
               adapting an already existing plan. The aim of this paper is to
               analyze the problem of plan reuse and to describe the state of
               the art based on a variety of approaches which might contribute
               to a solution of the problem. It describes the main problems and
               results that could be of some relevance for the integration of
               plan reuse into a deductive planning formalism. As a result, this
               description of the state of the art leads to a deeper insight
               into the complex problem of plan reuse, but also shows that the
               problem itself is still far from being solved.},

               were considered that allow for more flexibility. Although RCE
               incurs a discontinuous dependency and is relatively infrequent in
               discourse, previous corpus and acceptability judgment studies
               have shown that speakers prefer RCE over adjacent ordering when
               the RC is long in relation to the VP, the subject NP is
               indefinite, and the main verb is passive/presentative (Francis,
               2010; Francis \& Michaelis, 2014; Walker, 2013). The current
               study is the first to relate these conditional preferences to
               online measures of production. For a spoken production task that
               required speakers to construct sentences based on visual cues,
               results showed that the same factors that modulate choice of
               structure -- VP length, RC length, and definiteness of the subject
               NP -- also modulate voice initiation time. That is, when the

               structure becomes easier to produce. Following the approach of

               production biases, one of which favors early placement of

               encoding is primarily or exclusively affected by production ease,
               rather than communicative considerations. This contrasts with
               proposals that speakers' preferences during grammatical encoding
               reflect a trade-off between production ease and communicative
               goals. In three recall sentence production experiments, we
               investigate Japanese speakers' production of optional object
               case-marking. Case-marking conveys information about the intended
               sentence interpretation, facilitating comprehension, but it also
               increases production effort. We find that Japanese speakers are
               more likely to produce case-marking when the properties of the
               sentence would otherwise bias comprehenders against the intended
               interpretation. Experiment 1 observes this effect based on the

               based on the plausibility of the intended grammatical function
               assignment, even when animacy is held constant. We discuss how
               speakers might achieve this type of trade-off. In addition to

               examine whether these biases extend beyond language to constrain
               one of the most complex human behaviors: music improvisation.
               Using a large corpus of improvised solos from eminent jazz

               of easy first in improvised music, with the beginning of musical
               phrases containing both more frequent and less complex sequences.

               syntactically simpler picture descriptions (adjective-noun
               phrases, e.g., the red book) to those of more complex

               also lexically more complex (e.g., the book and the car vs. the

              often characterized as ``agrammatic'' because their output mostly

              function words, like articles and prepositions, and correct
              morphological endings. Among the earliest accounts of agrammatic
              output in the early 1900s was the ``economy of effort'' idea whereby
              agrammatic speech is construed as a way of coping with increases
              in the cost of language production: production-related effort is
              reduced by saying only the most important (meaning-carrying)
              elements in the sentence. This idea resurfaced in the 1980s, but

               excessively, blurting out answers, and interrupting others.
               OBJECTIVE: In this study, we examined language production in ADHD
               and non-ADHD controls to determine whether these types of
               language production problems are apparent in adults with ADHD.
               METHOD: Participants (18-35 years old, 53.3\% male) were asked to
               describe networks of colored dots that contained two branches
               that differed in length and complexity. According to the
               Minimal-Load Principle (Levelt, 1989), participants should prefer
               to describe a shorter and less complex branch first, in order to
               minimize planning and memory demands when formulating a
               description of the network. The dependent measures focused on
               which branch participants chose to describe first and the fluency
               of the descriptions. Four types of disfluency were examined:
               filled pauses, silent pauses, repetitions, and repairs. RESULTS:
               There was no difference between ADHD participants and controls in
               the decisions they made when describing the networks (p > .10, η²
               = .004). Participants in both groups preferred to describe a
               short branch before describing a long branch and decisions were
               unaffected by complexity. However, ADHD participants did produce
               more words overall, t(73) = -2.33, p < .05, η² = .07, and they
               also produced more disfluencies, F(4, 70) = 2.98, p < .05, η² =
               .15, even after adjusting for number of words produced.
               CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest less language efficiency and
               reduced fluency in ADHD, and that language production issues
               remain in adults with ADHD, similar to the issues commonly
               reported in children with ADHD.},

               consisting of two branches, and their task was to describe the

              How do strategies change with age, how can individual differences

              shifts from suboptimal to optimal strategies? In order to detect
              such differential strategy use, developmental psychology currently

              role of age and use of cues (e.g., word order, verbal agreement,

              as a function of participants' age and sentence characteristics

              spoken language, but little is known about how speech disfluencies
              impact novel word learning. We investigated how monolingual and
              bilingual adults learn novel words under disfluent speech
              conditions, focusing on fillers such as uh and um. If fillers
              highlight novelty, they might be an especially potent cue during
              word learning; however, because fillers also signal uncertainty,
              listeners may be less willing to learn in a disfluent condition.
              We also tested whether an effect of fillers on word learning would
              be moderated by bilingual experience, expecting that bilinguals
              would be affected differently because their exposure to
              distributional information within each language is reduced
              relative to monolinguals. In Experiments 1 and 2, where
              participants were exposed only to novel words, we found that
              participants learned words equally well in fluent and disfluent
              conditions, and that this effect was not moderated by bilingual
              experience. In Experiment 3, when novel words were embedded within
              a larger set of known words, we observed a bilingualism by
              condition interaction, wherein bilinguals benefited from fluency,

              and, on each trial, one specific strategy is selected and
              executed. Determining how many strategies are used by a
              participant as well as their identification at a trial level is a
              challenging problem for researchers. In the current paper, we
              propose a new method - the non-parametric mixture model - to
              efficiently disentangle hidden strategies in cognitive
              psychological data, based on observed response times. The
              developed method derived from standard hidden Markov modeling.
              Importantly, we used a model-free approach where a particular
              shape of a response time distribution does not need to be assumed.
              This has the considerable advantage of avoiding potentially
              unreliable results when an inappropriate response time
              distribution is assumed. Through three simulation studies and two
              applications to real data, we repeatedly demonstrated that the
              non-parametric mixture model is able to reliably recover hidden
              strategies present in the data as well as to accurately estimate
              the number of concurrent strategies. The results also showed that
              this new method is more efficient than a standard parametric
              approach. The non-parametric mixture model is therefore a useful
              statistical tool for strategy identification that can be applied
              in many areas of cognitive psychology. To this end, practical
              guidelines are provided for researchers wishing to apply the

              many contexts are not easily predictable in a forward fashion. In
              English, for example, many frequent verbs do not carry unique
              meaning on their own but instead, rely on another word or words
              that follow them to become meaningful. Upon reading take a the
              processor often cannot easily predict walk as the next word. But
              the system can ``look back'' and integrate walk more easily when
              it follows take a (e.g., as opposed to *make|get|have a walk). In

              literature is replete with references to a one-word, a two-word,
              and a later multiword stage in language development, but with
              little empirical evidence, and with little account for how and why
              utterances grow. To address these questions, we analyze speech
              samples from 25 children between the ages of 14 and 43 months; we
              construct distributions of their utterances of lengths one to five

               successful clause-final verbal prediction as well as robust
               maintenance of such predictions has been argued to be a
               cross-linguistic generalisation for SOV languages such as German
               and Japanese. In this paper, we show that native speakers of
               Hindi (an SOV language) falter in forming a clause-final
               structure in the presence of a centre-embedded relative clause
               with a non-canonical word order. In particular, the fallibility
               of the parser is illustrated by the formation of a grammatically
               illicit locally coherent parse during online processing. Such a
               parse should not be formed if the grammatically licit matrix
               clause final structure was being successfully formed. The
               formation of a locally coherent parse is further illustrated by
               probing various syntactic dependencies via targeted questions. We
               show that the parser's susceptibility to form such structures is
               not driven by top-down processing, rather the effect can only be
               explained through a bottom-up parsing approach. Further, our
               investigation suggests that while plausibility is essential,
               presence of overt agreement features might not be necessary for
               forming a locally coherent parse in Hindi. These results go

               priming can be used to study the potential of these models to

              language comprehension. However, this network's role in language

              whether all or only some language regions contribute to
              production, and which aspects of production these regions support.
              Across 3 functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments that
              rely on robust individual-subject analyses, we characterize the
              language network's response to high-level production demands. We
              report 3 novel results. First, sentence production, spoken or
              typed, elicits a strong response throughout the language network.
              Second, the language network responds to both phrase-structure
              building and lexical access demands, although the response to
              phrase-structure building is stronger and more spatially
              extensive, present in every language region. Finally, contra some
              proposals, we find no evidence of brain regions-within or outside
              the language network-that selectively support phrase-structure
              building in production relative to comprehension. Instead, all

              comprehension, suggesting that production incurs a greater cost
              for the language network. Together, these results align with the
              idea that language comprehension and production draw on the same
              knowledge representations, which are stored in a distributed

              studies have demonstrated that pseudowords can be indicative of

              pseudowords is supported by the very same processes, activating a
              common semantic memory system, is currently not known. Here, we
              take advantage of recent progresses from computational linguistics
              models allowing to induce meaning representations for
              out-of-vocabulary strings of letters via domain-general
              associative-learning mechanisms applied to natural language. We
              combined these models with data from priming tasks, in which
              participants are showed two strings of letters presented
              sequentially one after the other and are then asked to indicate if
              the latter is a word or a pseudoword. In Experiment 1 we
              reanalyzed the data of the largest behavioral database on semantic
              priming, while in Experiment 2 we ran an independent replication

              pseudoword, participants' reaction times increased and accuracy
              decreased). These findings indicate that the same associative
              mechanisms governing word meaning also subserve the processing of
              pseudowords, suggesting in turn that human semantic memory can be
              conceived as a distributional system that builds upon a

              complex-initial sentences, production durations of ``shoe'' and
              ``and'' were longer on switch than nonswitch trials; in
              simple-initial sentences, in Experiments 1--2, speech rate was not
              affected by switching until ``mesa'' was produced, and in Experiment
              3 not until ``above'' was produced. Thus, bilinguals paid language
              switch costs just before or just as they started to produce a
              phrase with a language switch in it, suggesting that bilinguals
              complete phrasal planning in the default language before switching

               of these papers provide new techniques for refining computational
               models, giving better methods for taking empirical data and
               producing accurate computational models of the cognitive systems
               that produce them. The other two papers focus on explanation:
               using models to elucidate the underlying processes affecting

               Case Constraint (PCC) effects, this paper shows that there can be
               no agreement in ϕ-features (PERSON, NUMBER, GENDER/NOUN-CLASS)
               which systematically lacks a morpho-phonological footprint. That
               is, there is no such thing as ``abstract'' ϕ-agreement, null across
               the entire paradigm. Applying the same diagnostic to instances of
               clitic doubling, we see that these do involve syntactic
               agreement. This cannot be because clitic doubling is agreement;
               it behaves like movement (and unlike agreement) in a variety of
               respects. Nor can this be because clitic doubling, qua movement,
               is contingent on prior agreement---since the claim that all
               movement depends on prior agreement is demonstrably false. Clitic
               doubling requires prior agreement because it is an instance of
               non-local head movement, and movement of X0 to Y0 always requires
               a prior syntactic relationship between Y0 and XP. In local head
               movement (the kind that is already permitted under the Head
               Movement Constraint), this requirement is trivially satisfied by
               (c-)selection. But in non-local cases, agreement must fill this
               role.},

               effects offer a testing ground for theories of Agree and of
               syntactic features, both those on nominals and those found on
               agreement probes. This article offers a new theory of PCC effects
               in an interaction/satisfaction theory of Agree (Deal 2015a) and
               shows the advantages of this framework in capturing PCC typology.
               On this model, probes are specified for interaction, determining
               which features will be copied to them, and for satisfaction,
               determining which features will cause probing to stop. Applied to
               the PCC, this theory (a) captures all four types of PCC effect
               recognized by Nevins (2007) under a unified notion of Agree; (b)
               captures the restriction of PCC effects to contexts of ``Double
               Weakness'' in many prominent examples (e.g., in Italian, Greek,
               and Basque, where PCC effects hold only when both objects are
               expressed with clitics); (c) naturally extends to PCC effects in

               one or both objects, as well as to the absence of PCC effects in
               some languages with clitics or agreement for both objects. Two

               new notation for probes' interaction and satisfaction
               specifications, clarifying the absence of
               uninterpretable/unvalued features as drivers of Agree; and a

               Case Constraint effects, dative-nominative configurations, and
               copula constructions. The main line of approach in the recent
               literature is to attribute these effects to failures of ϕ-Agree
               or, more specifically, failures of nominal licensing or case
               checking. We propose that the problem in these configurations is
               unrelated to nominal licensing, but is instead the result of a
               probe participating in more than one Agree dependency, a
               configuration we refer to as feature gluttony. Feature gluttony
               does not in and of itself lead to ungrammaticality; rather, it
               can create irresolvably conflicting requirements for subsequent
               operations. We argue that in the case of clitic configurations, a
               probe that agrees with more than one DP creates an intervention
               problem for clitic doubling. In violations involving
               morphological agreement, gluttony in features may result in a

              plan lexically before they start producing an utterance, is an
              important issue for research into speech production, but remains
              highly controversial. The present research investigated this issue
              using the semantic blocking effect, which refers to the widely
              observed effects that participants take longer to say aloud the
              names of items in pictures when the pictures in a block of trials
              in an experiment depict items that belong to the same semantic
              category than different categories. As this effect is often
              interpreted as a reflection of difficulty in lexical selection,
              the current study took the semantic blocking effect and its
              associated pattern of event-related brain potentials (ERPs) as a
              proxy to test whether lexical planning during sentence production
              extends beyond the first noun when a subject noun-phrase includes
              two nouns, such as ``The chair and the boat are both red'' and
              ``The chair above the boat is red''. The results showed a semantic
              blocking effect both in onset latencies and in ERPs during the
              utterance of the first noun of these complex noun-phrases but not
              for the second noun. The indication, therefore, is that the
              lexical planning scope does not encompass this second noun-phrase.
              Indeed, the present findings are in line with accounts that
              propose radically incremental lexical planning, in which speakers
              plan ahead only one word at a time. This study also provides a
              highly novel example of using ERPs to examine the production of
              long utterances, and it is hoped the present demonstration of the
              effectiveness of this approach inspires further application of ERP
              techniques in this area of research.},

              prime sentences which varied in their conceptual overlap with
              target events and violated the normal positions (Experiment 1) or
              order (Experiment 2) of conceptual contents of motion events were
              designed to test whether they are potent enough to induce Chinese
              speakers to change their preference in encoding motion events.
              Results showed that conceptual overlap influenced Chinese
              speakers' choices of conceptual information (manner and/or path

              utterance planning and involved studying the synchronization
              between visual gaze and the production of sentences that refer to
              objects in the immediate visual environment. However, it remains
              unclear how the visual grouping of these objects might influence
              this process. To shed light on this issue, the present research
              examined the effects of the visual grouping of objects in a visual
              display on utterance planning in two experiments. Participants
              produced utterances of the form ``The snail and the necklace are
              above/below/on the left/right side of the toothbrush'' for objects
              containing these referents (e.g., a snail, a necklace and a
              toothbrush). These objects were grouped using classic Gestalt
              principles of color similarity (Experiment 1) and common region
              (Experiment 2) so that the induced perceptual grouping was
              congruent or incongruent with the required phrasal organization.
              The results showed that speech onset latencies were shorter in
              congruent than incongruent conditions. The findings therefore

              referents and the required phrasal organization can influence
              speech production. Such findings suggest that, when language is

               utterances, is the planning unit the whole subject phrase or a
               smaller ``functional phrase'' within the subject phrase? Allum and
               Wheeldon (2007) reported that speakers show faster onset
               latencies in producing utterances like The flower above the house
               is red , where the subject consists of two functional phrases (
               the flower and above the house ) than in producing The flower and
               the house are red , where there is a single, longer functional
               phrase ( The flower and the house ), both in head-initial

               This has been taken to suggest that the functional phrase is a

              particular rhythmic pattern could affect the planning of speech
              production before articulation. We recorded electrophysiological
              (EEG) and behavioural (reaction time) data while participants read
              aloud a target speech in Chinese. Target speeches were sentences
              or phrases consisting four characters, with regular (e.g., the 2 +
              2 pattern; numbers in the brackets represent the number of
              syllables) or irregular (e.g., 1 + 3) rhythmic patterns, which
              were preceded by congruent or incongruent musical rhythmic
              patterns formed by simple pure tones with different temporal
              intervals. Behavioural and ERP findings indicated a rhythmic
              priming effect in comparing congruent and incongruent conditions
              in the regular target speeches, but not in the irregular ones. An
              early component (N100) that was elicited in response to target
              speeches that were rhythmically mismatched to primes was linked to
              the detection of hierarchical linguistic units, which did not

              thought to reflect the violation of expectation on rhythmic

              pattern constrains grammatical and prosodic encoding during speech
              production, and support the hypothesis that speakers form a

               this question in two production experiments, where speakers heard

               in English and Spanish.Methods: The sample included
               Spanish-English speaking children (n?=?25). Investigators
               employed a repeated measures analysis of variance with one
               within-subjects effect (time).Results: Overall there was a
               significant difference in sentence repetition accuracy between
               time points showing growth in English (p?<?.001, d?=?1.24), and
               no significant change in Spanish. Results highlight malleable
               English grammatical forms (e.g. conditional (if-then); question
               inversion of auxiliaries; and subordinating conjunctions) and
               forms that remained challenging for DLLs in first grade (e.g.

              output disturbances (dysfluencies) and the development of language
              production processes. The data consist of transcribed weekly
              speech samples of a Dutch boy between 2;4 and 2;11. The period of

              occurrence of dysfluencies (i.e. repetitions, revisions and
              incomplete phrases) shows a significant increase and a subsequent
              decline. Whereas in the first half of the observation period the
              dysfluencies are distributed relatively randomly over sentences,
              in the second half they tend to concentrate in function words and
              sentence-initial words. The decline of dysfluency rate is shown to
              be related to an abundant use of a few 'syntactic frames'. It is

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Five to eight percent of preschool children develop
              stuttering, a speech disorder with clearly observable, hallmark
              symptoms: sound repetitions, prolongations, and blocks. While the
              speech motor processes underlying stuttering have been widely
              documented in adults, few studies to date have assessed the speech
              motor dynamics of stuttering near its onset. We assessed
              fundamental characteristics of speech movements in preschool
              children who stutter and their fluent peers to determine if
              atypical speech motor characteristics described for adults are
              early features of the disorder or arise later in the development
              of chronic stuttering. METHODS: Orofacial movement data were
              recorded from 58 children who stutter and 43 children who do not
              stutter aged 4;0 to 5;11 (years; months) in a sentence production
              task. For single speech movements and multiple speech movement
              sequences, we computed displacement amplitude, velocity, and
              duration. For the phrase level movement sequence, we computed an
              index of articulation coordination consistency for repeated
              productions of the sentence. RESULTS: Boys who stutter, but not
              girls, produced speech with reduced amplitudes and velocities of
              articulatory movement. All children produced speech with similar
              durations. Boys, particularly the boys who stuttered, had more
              variable patterns of articulatory coordination compared to girls.
              CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to demonstrate sex-specific
              differences in speech motor control processes between preschool
              boys and girls who are stuttering. The sex-specific lag in speech
              motor development in many boys who stutter likely has significant
              implications for the dramatically different recovery rates between
              male and female preschoolers who stutter. Further, our findings
              document that atypical speech motor development is an early
              feature of stuttering.},

              on contextual factors (e.g., time pressure), linguistic factors
              (e.g., ease of structural processing), and cognitive factors
              (e.g., production speed). The present study tests the influence of
              the availability of multiple syntactic alternatives (i.e.,
              syntactic flexibility) on the scope of advance planning during the
              recall of Dutch dative phrases. We manipulated syntactic
              flexibility by using verbs with a strong bias or a weak bias
              toward one structural alternative in sentence frames accepting
              both verbs (e.g., strong/weak bias: De ober schotelt/serveert de
              klant de maaltijd [voor] ``The waiter dishes out/serves the
              customer the meal''). To assess lexical planning scope, we varied
              the frequency of the first post-verbal noun (N1, Experiment 1) or
              the second post-verbal noun (N2, Experiment 2). In each
              experiment, 36 speakers produced the verb phrases in a rapid
              serial visual presentation (RSVP) paradigm. On each trial, they
              read a sentence presented one word at a time, performed a short
              distractor task, and then saw a sentence preamble (e.g., De ober{\ldots})
              which they had to complete to form the presented sentence. Onset
              latencies were compared using linear mixed effects models. N1
              frequency did not produce any effects. N2 frequency only affected
              sentence onsets in the weak verb bias condition and especially in
              slow speakers. These findings highlight the dependency of planning
              scope during sentence recall on the grammatical properties of the

              heavily on analyses of this gaze-speech link. To identify
              systematic sources of variability in message and sentence
              formulation, two experiments evaluated differences in formulation
              for sentences describing ``easy'' and ``hard'' events (more codable
              and less codable events) with preferred and dispreferred
              structures (actives and passives). Experiment 1 employed a
              subliminal cuing manipulation and a cumulative priming
              manipulation to increase production of passive sentences.
              Experiment 2 examined the influence of event codability on
              formulation without a cuing manipulation. In both experiments,
              speakers showed an early preference for looking at the agent of
              the event when constructing active sentences. This preference was
              attenuated by event codability, suggesting that speakers were less
              likely to prioritize encoding of a single character at the outset
              of formulation in ``easy'' events than in ``harder'' events.
              Accessibility of the agent influenced formulation primarily when
              an event was ``harder'' to describe. Formulation of passive
              sentences in Experiment 1 also began with early fixations to the
              agent but changed with exposure to passive syntax: speakers were
              more likely to consider the patient as a suitable sentential
              starting point after cumulative priming. The results show that the
              message-to-language mapping in production can vary with the ease

              determined to a considerable extent by verb biases. For example,
              some English and Dutch ditransitive verbs have a preference for
              the prepositional object dative, whereas others are typically used
              with the double object dative. In this study, we compare the
              effect of these biases on structure selection in (S)VO and (S)OV
              dative clauses in the Corpus of Spoken Dutch (CGN). This
              comparison allowed us to make inferences about the size of the
              advance planning scope during spontaneous speaking: If the verb is
              an obligatory component of clause-level advance planning scope, as
              is claimed by the hypothesis of hierarchical incrementality, then
              biases should exert their influence on structure choices,
              regardless of early (VO) or late (OV) position of the verb in the

              strictly guided by lexical availability, as claimed by linear
              incrementality, then the verb and its associated biases can only
              influence structure choices in VO sentences. We tested these
              predictions by analyzing structure choices in the CGN, using mixed
              logit models. Our results support a combination of linear and

              single words into more complex syntactic structures such as noun
              phrases or sentences. In the present study, event-related
              potentials (ERPs) were used to investigate the time course of
              syntactic planning. Thirty-three volunteers described visually
              animated scenes using naming formats varying in syntactic
              complexity: from simple words ('W', e.g., ``triangle'', ``red'',
              ``square'', ``green'', ``to fly towards''), to noun phrases ('NP',
              e.g., ``the red triangle'', ``the green square'', ``to fly
              towards''), to a sentence ('S', e.g., ``The red triangle flies
              towards the green square.''). Behaviourally, we observed an
              increase in errors and corrections with increasing syntactic
              complexity, indicating a successful experimental manipulation. In
              the ERPs following scene onset, syntactic complexity variations
              were found in a P300-like component ('S'/'NP'>'W') and a
              fronto-central negativity (linear increase with syntactic

              unpredictable for the participant, as the disambiguation occurred
              only later in the animation. Time-locked to the moment of visual
              disambiguation of the action and thus the verb, we observed

              manipulated verb bias for English double-object (DO) and
              prepositional-object (PO) dative structures: some verbs appeared
              solely in the DO structure (DO-only), others solely in PO
              (PO-only) and yet others equally in both (Equi). Structural
              choices during subsequent free-choice sentence production revealed

              reliable linear trend in DO production that was consistent with

              verb bias effect, three results suggested that Equi verbs, which
              were associated equally with the two structures, engendered
              verb-specific competition and required additional resources for
              choosing the dispreferred DO structure. First, DO production with
              Equi verbs but not the other verbs correlated with participants'
              inhibition ability. Second, utterance duration prior to the choice
              of a DO structure showed a quadratic trend (DO-only PO-only) with

              trend (DO-only PO-only) prior to choosing DO, suggesting that

              durations, eye movements and individual differences in executive

              differences in planning strategies exhibited by speakers of

              syntactic dependency. MacDonald et al. () have argued that the
              results of our investigation provide little new information on the
              topic. We disagree. Examining the production of subject versus
              object extractions in two constructions across two experimental
              paradigms-relative clauses in Experiment 1 and wh-questions in
              Experiment 2-we found a strikingly similar pattern: reliable
              differences in latency and word durations, as well as in rates of
              disfluencies, signaling a greater cost associated with planning
              and uttering the syntactically more complex object extractions.
              MacDonald et al. reject that interpretation, namely that the
              differences we observed in the production of subject versus object
              extractions demonstrate asymmetric production difficulties. Here
              we address the concerns they raise by clarifying confusion and
              presenting novel experimental evidence in support of our original

              to one prominent class of accounts (experience-based accounts;
              e.g., Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008; Gennari \& MacDonald, 2008, 2009;
              Wells et al., 2009), certain structures cause comprehension
              difficulty due to their scarcity in the language. But why are some
              structures less frequent than others? In two elicited-production
              experiments we investigated syntactic complexity effects in
              relative clauses (Experiment 1) and wh-questions (Experiment 2)
              varying in whether or not they contained non-local dependencies.
              In both experiments, we found reliable durational differences
              between subject-extracted structures (which only contain local
              dependencies) and object-extracted structures (which contain
              nonlocal dependencies): Participants took longer to begin and
              produce object-extractions. Furthermore, participants were more
              likely to be disfluent in the object-extracted constructions.
              These results suggest that there is a cost associated with
              planning and uttering the more syntactically complex,
              object-extracted structures, and that this cost manifests in the
              form of longer durations and disfluencies. Although the precise
              nature of this cost remains to be determined, these effects
              provide one plausible explanation for the relative rarity of

	abstract = {Planning to speak is a challenge for the brain, and the challenge
              varies between and within languages. Yet, little is known about
              how neural processes react to these variable challenges beyond the
              planning of individual words. Here, we examine how fundamental
              differences in syntax shape the time course of sentence planning.
              Most languages treat alike (i.e., align with each other) the 2
              uses of a word like ``gardener'' in ``the gardener crouched'' and
              in ``the gardener planted trees.'' A minority keeps these formally
              distinct by adding special marking in 1 case, and some languages
              display both aligned and nonaligned expressions. Exploiting such a
              contrast in Hindi, we used electroencephalography (EEG) and eye
              tracking to suggest that this difference is associated with
              distinct patterns of neural processing and gaze behavior during
              early planning stages, preceding phonological word form
              preparation. Planning sentences with aligned expressions induces
              larger synchronization in the theta frequency band, suggesting
              higher working memory engagement, and more visual attention to
              agents than planning nonaligned sentences, suggesting delayed
              commitment to the relational details of the event. Furthermore,
              plain, unmarked expressions are associated with larger
              desynchronization in the alpha band than expressions with special
              markers, suggesting more engagement in information processing to
              keep overlapping structures distinct during planning. Our findings
              contrast with the observation that the form of aligned expressions
              is simpler, and they suggest that the global preference for
              alignment is driven not by its neurophysiological effect on
              sentence planning but by other sources, possibly by aspects of
              production flexibility and fluency or by sentence comprehension.
              This challenges current theories on how production and
              comprehension may affect the evolution and distribution of
              syntactic variants in the world's languages.},

              the ``clause chain,'' in which 20 or more clauses can be stacked
              to form a sentence. The Papuan language Nungon is among a subset
              of clause chaining languages that require ``switch-reference''
              suffixes on nonfinal verbs in chains. These suffixes announce
              whether the subject of each upcoming clause will differ from the
              subject of the previous clause. We examine two major issues in
              psycholinguistics: predictive processing in comprehension, and
              advance planning in production. Whereas previous work on other
              languages has demonstrated that sentence planning can be
              incremental, switch-reference marking would seem to prohibit
              strictly incremental planning, as it requires speakers to plan the
              next clause before they can finish producing the current one. This
              suggests an intriguing possibility: planning strategies may be
              fundamentally different in Nungon. We used a mobile eye-tracker
              and solar-powered laptops in a remote village in Papua, New
              Guinea, to track Nungon speakers' gaze in two experiments:

              fixation data failed to find evidence that switch-reference
              marking is used for predictive processing. However, during

              switch-reference markers, and, by extension, the subjects they
              presage. We propose that this degree of advance syntactic planning
              pushes the boundaries of what is known about sentence planning,

              deficit in procedural learning. We explored an extension of this
              hypothesis that a core deficit in SLI involves a domain-general
              problem in planning. Method: We used a dowel-transport task to
              study the extent to which 13 children with SLI and 14 typically
              developing (TD) controls (ages over both groups between 8;10
              [years;months] and 12;11) would adopt initially awkward grasps
              that ensured comfortable final grasps when reaching out to move a
              dowel from 1 position to another (the end-state comfort effect).
              We predicted that children with SLI would be less likely to use
              end-state comfort grasps than would TD children. Results: Contrary
              to our prediction, when awkward grasps were needed to ensure
              comfortable final grasps, participants with SLI showed the
              end-state comfort effect as often as the TD children did.
              Unexpectedly, however, in trials where awkward grasps were not
              needed for comfortable final grasps, the participants with SLI
              used more awkward grasps than did the TD participants after trials

              structural relations among constituents (i.e., relational
              information), and selecting the appropriate lexical items to
              convey the intended message (non-relational elements). However,
              the precise way relational and non-relational information are
              computed when undertaking linguistic encoding is not clear. This
              paper explores how the pre-linguistic message undergoes linguistic
              encoding, and what kind of information (relational or
              non-relational) is prioritized in doing so. We analyze the
              production planning of Relative Clauses in Spanish (a head-initial
              language) and Japanese (a head-final language) by monolingual
              speakers, by means of the eye-tracking method while participants
              described colored pictures. Although in both Spanish and Japanese
              the structure under study is the same (with the same syntactic
              configuration), word order is entirely opposite between both
              languages. In Japanese, the head noun is not uttered until the end
              of the clause, thus making it possible to explore sentence
              planning in a structure where the syntactically most dominant
              element (the head noun, HN) is not the first element. Variables
              tested were type of relative clause, with either the agent or the
              patient as head noun, and the animacy of the agent and the patient
              of the event, the latter allowing the manipulation of the

              monolinguals, in turn, showed a pattern in which both structural
              and linear information appear to be more closely related from the

              little effect on gaze patterns. Results point to a planning

              Words are commonly produced in sequences, yet most ERP studies
              have used single-word experimental designs. Single-word designs
              reduce potential ERP overlap in word sequence production. However,
              word sequence production engages brain mechanisms in different
              ways than single word production. In particular, speech monitoring
              and planning mechanisms are more engaged than for single words
              since several words must be produced in a short period of time.
              This study evaluates the feasibility of recording ERP components
              in the context of word sequence production, and whether separate
              components could be isolated for each word. Scalp EEG data were
              acquired, while participants recited word sequences from memory at
              a regular pace, using a tongue-twister paradigm. The results
              revealed fronto-central error-related negativity, previously
              associated with speech monitoring, which could be distinguished
              for each word. Its peak amplitude was sensitive to Cycle and
              Phonological Similarity. However, an effect of sequential
              production was also observable on baseline measures, indicating
              baseline shifts throughout the word sequence due to concurrent
              sustained medial-frontal EEG activity. We also report a late left
              anterior negativity (LLAN), associated with verbal response
              planning and execution, onsetting around 100 ms before the first
              word in each cycle and sustained throughout the rest of the cycle.

              intonational phrase. These units are schemas: temporally
              structured sequences of remembered actions and their sensory
              outcomes. Schemas are activated and inhibited via associated
              goals, which are linked to specific meanings. Schemas may fuse
              together over developmental time with repeated use to form larger
              units, thereby affecting the relative timing of sequential action
              in participating schemas. In this way, the hierarchical structure
              of the speech plan and ensuing rhythm patterns of speech are a
              product of development. Individual schemas may also become
              differentiated during development, but only if subsequences are
              associated with meaning. The necessary association of action and
              meaning gives rise to assumptions about the primacy of certain
              linguistic forms in the production process. Overall, schema
              representations connect usage-based theories of language to the

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Analyses of language production of individuals with
               traumatic brain injury (TBI) place increasing emphasis on
               microlinguistic (i.e., within-sentence) patterns. It is unknown
               whether the observed problems involve implementation of
               well-formed sentence frames or represent a fundamental linguistic
               disturbance in computing sentence structure. This study
               investigated the cognitive basis for microlinguistic deficits in
               individuals with TBI. METHOD: Fifteen nonaphasic individuals with
               severe TBI and 6 age- and education-matched non brain-injured
               adults participated in this study. Monologic discourse samples
               were analyzed for pausing patterns, mazes, errors, and abandoned
               utterances. Measures of cognitive abilities were correlated with
               the sentence measures. RESULTS: The speakers with TBI produced
               more pauses between clauses (but not within clauses) as well as
               more mazes than did the non brain-injured speakers. Significant
               regression models were built. Raven's Coloured Progressive
               Matrices (Raven, 1965), a measure associated with working memory,
               predicted pause behavior, and Likenesses-Differences (Baker \&
               Leland, 1967), a measure of executive function, predicted maze
               behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Sentence planning impairments following
               TBI are associated with deficient organization and monitoring of
               language representations in working memory. These findings
               suggest that the deficits are due to problems in the recruitment
               and control of attention for sentence planning. These findings
               bear on sentence processing models that emphasize the activation,
               organization, and maintenance of language representations for
               accurate sentence production.},

	abstract = {Pitch peaks tend to be higher at the beginning of longer than
              shorter sentences (e.g., 'A farmer is pulling donkeys' vs 'A
              farmer is pulling a donkey and goat'), whereas pitch valleys at
              the ends of sentences are rather constant for a given speaker.
              These data seem to imply that speakers avoid dropping their voice
              pitch too low by planning the height of sentence-initial pitch
              peaks prior to speaking. However, the length effect on
              sentence-initial pitch peaks appears to vary across different
              types of sentences, speakers and languages. Therefore, the notion
              that speakers plan sentence intonation in advance due to the
              limitations in low voice pitch leaves part of the data
              unexplained. Consequently, this study suggests a complementary
              cognitive account of length-dependent pitch scaling. In
              particular, it proposes that the sentence-initial pitch raise in
              long sentences is related to high demands on mental resources
              during the early stages of sentence planning. To tap into the
              cognitive underpinnings of planning sentence intonation, this
              study adopts the methodology of recording eye movements during a
              picture description task, as the eye movements are the established
              approximation of the real-time planning processes. Measures of
              voice pitch (Fundamental Frequency) and incrementality (eye
              movements) are used to examine the relationship between (verbal)
              working memory (WM), incrementality of sentence planning and the
              height of sentence-initial pitch peaks.},

              production in speakers with agrammatic aphasia and control
              speakers, testing two competing models of GE. We queried whether
              speakers with agrammatic aphasia produce sentences word by word
              without advanced planning or whether hierarchical syntactic
              structure (i.e., verb argument structure; VAS) is encoded as part
              of the advanced planning unit. METHOD: Experiment 1 examined
              production of sentences with a predefined structure (i.e., ``The A
              and the B are above the C'') using eye tracking. Experiment 2
              tested production of transitive and unaccusative sentences without
              a predefined sentence structure in a verb-priming study. RESULTS:
              In Experiment 1, both speakers with agrammatic aphasia and young
              and age-matched control speakers used word-by-word strategies,
              selecting the first lemma (noun A) only prior to speech onset.
              However, in Experiment 2, unlike controls, speakers with
              agrammatic aphasia preplanned transitive and unaccusative
              sentences, encoding VAS before speech onset. CONCLUSIONS: Speakers
              with agrammatic aphasia show incremental, word-by-word production

              it remains unclear if and how word-level information affects

              of lexical priming on production of syntactic (active/passive)

              adults (HOA) described transitive actions (woman pulling horse)
              following lexical priming, wherein the relative ease of lexical
              retrieval for the Agent or Theme was manipulated via an auditory
              probe (what is happening with the woman/horse ?). It was examined
              whether or not PWA produce the sentence structure that allows
              earlier production of the primed word (e.g., passives when Theme
              was primed). Participants' eye fixation times to each character
              (Agent, Theme) were also monitored to examine if PWA show
              priming-induced preferential looks to one character from the
              earliest stage of production, consistent with word-driven
              planning. RESULTS: HOA showed increased production of passives
              over actives in the Theme vs. Agent prime condition. In eye
              fixation data, HOA showed priming-induced Theme advantage from the
              earliest time window (picture onset-400 milliseconds). PWA also
              showed a significant priming effect in off-line sentence
              production, with this priming effect being greater for the
              individuals whose syntactic processing is better preserved. In eye
              fixation data, however, PWA showed preferential fixations to the
              primed character at a later stage of sentence planning (400-800
              milliseconds), following equal fixation time to Agent and Theme
              during the earliest time window. CONCLUSION: HOA showed
              word-driven production in both off-line and real-time (eye
              fixations) production. Lexical accessibility effectively drove
              off-line syntactic production in PWA, especially for those whose
              syntactic capacity remains relatively preserved. However, PWA
              showed advanced processing of both characters in earliest eye
              fixation data, suggesting that successful word-driven off-line

              not systematically related to utterance type. Lastly, pause
              postures increase in frequency and duration as utterance length
              increases, suggesting that pause postures are at least partially

	abstract = {The nature of syntactic planning for language production may
              reflect language-specific processes, but an alternative is that
              syntactic planning is an example of more domain-general action
              planning processes. If so, language and non-linguistic action
              planning should have identifiable commonalities, consistent with
              an underlying shared system. Action and language research have had
              little contact, however, and such comparisons are therefore
              lacking. Here, we address this gap by taking advantage of a
              striking similarity between two phenomena in language and action
              production. One is known as syntactic priming-the tendency to
              re-use a recently produced sentence structure-and the second is
              hysteresis-the tendency to re-use a previously executed abstract
              action plan, such as a limb movement. We examined syntactic
              priming/hysteresis in parallel language and action tasks
              intermixed in a single experimental session. Our goals were to
              establish the feasibility of investigating language and action
              planning within the same participants and to inform debates on the
              language-specific vs. domain-general nature of planning systems.
              In both action and language tasks, target trials afforded two
              alternative orders of subcomponents in the participant's response:
              in the language task, a picture could be described with two
              different word orders, and in the action task, locations on a
              touch screen could be touched in two different orders. Prime
              trials preceding the target trial promoted one of two plans in the
              respective domain. Manipulations yielded higher rates of primed
              behavior in both tasks. In an exploratory cross-domain analysis,
              there was some evidence for stronger priming effects in some
              combinations of action and language priming conditions than
              others. These results establish a method for investigating the
              degree to which language planning is part of a domain-general
              action planning system.},

              linguistic structures. Because sentences are normally built
              incrementally, the information encoded in a sentence-initial
              increment is critical for explaining how the mapping process
              starts and for predicting its timecourse. Two experiments tested
              whether and when speakers prioritize encoding of different types
              of information at the outset of formulation by comparing
              production of descriptions of transitive events (e.g., A dog is
              chasing the mailman) that differed on two dimensions: the ease of
              naming individual characters and the ease of apprehending the
              event gist (i.e., encoding the relational structure of the event).
              To additionally manipulate ease of encoding, speakers described
              the target events after receiving lexical primes (facilitating
              naming; Experiment 1) or structural primes (facilitating
              generation of a linguistic structure; Experiment 2). Both
              properties of the pictured events and both types of primes
              influenced the form of target descriptions and the timecourse of
              formulation: character-specific variables increased the
              probability of speakers encoding one character with priority at
              the outset of formulation, while the ease of encoding event gist
              and of generating a syntactic structure increased the likelihood
              of early encoding of information about both characters. The

              Incrementality and Linear Incrementality - differ in their
              assumptions about the coordination of processes that map preverbal
              information onto language. Previous studies showed that, in native
              (L1) speakers, this coordination can vary with the ease of
              executing the message-level and sentence-level processes necessary
              to plan and produce an utterance. We report the first series of
              experiments to systematically examine how linguistic experience
              influences sentence planning in native (L1) speakers (i.e.,
              speakers with life-long experience using the target language) and
              non-native (L2) speakers (i.e., speakers with less experience
              using the target language). In all experiments, speakers
              spontaneously generated one-sentence descriptions of simple events
              in Dutch (L1) and English (L2). Analyses of eye-movements across
              early and late time windows (pre- and post-400 ms) compared the
              extent of early message-level encoding and the onset of linguistic
              encoding. In Experiment 1, speakers were more likely to engage in
              extensive message-level encoding and to delay sentence-level
              encoding when using their L2. Experiments 2-4 selectively
              facilitated encoding of the preverbal message, encoding of the
              agent character (i.e., the first content word in active
              sentences), and encoding of the sentence verb (i.e., the second
              content word in active sentences) respectively. Experiment 2
              showed that there is no delay in the onset of L2 linguistic
              encoding when speakers are familiar with the events. Experiments 3
              and 4 showed that the delay in the onset of L2 linguistic encoding
              is not due to speakers delaying encoding of the agent, but due to
              a preference to encode information needed to select a suitable
              verb early in the formulation process. Overall, speakers prefer to
              temporally separate message-level from sentence-level encoding and
              to prioritize encoding of relational information when planning L2
              sentences, consistent with Hierarchical Incrementality.},

              production and comprehension. Previous research suggests that
              animacy and conceptual similarity of the noun concepts within
              complex descriptive phrases modulate structural preferences in
              production, and processing cost in comprehension. For example,
              animate-head phrases such as the girl that the boy is pulling are
              rare in production and more difficult to understand in
              comprehension. In contrast, phrases with passive clauses such as
              the girl being pulled by the boy are commonly produced and more
              easily understood, as are inanimate-head structures such as the
              truck the boy is pulling. In three picture-based studies, we
              examined the mechanisms underlying semantic similarity effects in
              producing and comprehending these phrases. Study 1 investigated
              structural preferences in production, whereas Study 2 investigated
              processing cost in comprehension. Study 3 used eye-tracking to
              examine the time-course of production processes. The results
              showed that semantic similarity elicited competition during phrase
              planning, influenced the choice of syntactic structure in
              production, and engendered comprehension difficulty in
              animate-head active configurations. Structural preferences,
              fixation probabilities reflecting production planning processes
              and comprehension cost significantly correlated with measures of
              conceptual similarity across the three studies. We argue that
              similarity-based competition modulates sentence production and
              comprehension processes when verbs are planned or interpreted,
              i.e., when event-based semantic or syntactic roles are determined.
              In addition to task-specific processes, we suggest that a similar
              and shared semantic competition mechanism underlies both
              production and comprehension, a view consistent with existing
              evidence for common brain regions recruited in both tasks.},

               Distance Hypothesis, and the Structural Distance Hypothesis) have
               been proposed to account for the subject-object asymmetry found
               in children's performance with head-initial RCs in English. The
               structure of Chinese head-final RCs is minimally different from

               to examine the effect of different factors that are confounded in

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sentence construction and syntactic organization are
              known to be poor in children with specific language impairments
              (SLI), but little is known about the way in which children with
              SLI approach language tasks, and static standardized tests
              contribute little to the differentiation of skills within the
              population of children with language impairments (LI). Information
              about the nature and intensity of prompts that facilitate sentence
              construction for a particular child may be useful in planning
              effective intervention. AIMS: This paper describes the development
              of a dynamic assessment (DA) task which requires implicit
              knowledge of syntactic structure. The aim was to formulate a valid
              and reliable procedure for the DA of sentence formulation that
              could yield useful information for planning intervention for
              children with LI. METHODS \& PROCEDURES: The Dynamic Assessment of
              Sentence Structure (DASS) was employed on 24 children aged 8-10
              years, with identified language impairments, who were tested four
              times, at 4 monthly intervals. OUTCOMES \& RESULTS: A range of
              scores was elicited with no limiting ceiling or floor effects, and
              the test showed high internal reliability of α= 0.833. Inter-rater
              reliability was high. Concurrent validity was demonstrated by
              significant correlation with scores obtained on the CELF-3(UK) and
              predictive validity of the measure was also found to exceed that
              of the standardized test measure. Information about the ability of
              the children to use strategies and less directive prompts, and to
              transfer learning between items was elicited, and the information
              was thought to be useful by speech and language therapists
              involved in their management. CONCLUSIONS \& IMPLICATIONS: The
              application of DA principles to the assessment of children
              previously diagnosed with LI, for the purposes of finding out more
              information about their potential to benefit from language
              intervention, was found to be effective. The tool developed was
              shown to be valid and reliable, and it has potentially important

               whether they fell within the same phrase (?the watch and the

              for the analysis of linguistic phenomena observed in continuous
              language production during fMRI. Most neuroimaging studies
              investigating language have so far focussed on single word or - to
              a smaller extent - sentence processing, mostly due to
              methodological considerations. Natural language production,
              however, is far more than the mere combination of words to larger
              units. Therefore, the present study aimed at relating brain
              activation to linguistic phenomena like word-finding difficulties
              or syntactic completeness in a continuous language fMRI paradigm.
              A picture description task with special constraints was used to
              provoke hesitation phenomena and speech errors. The transcribed
              speech sample was segmented into events of one second and each
              event was assigned to one category of a complex schema especially
              developed for this purpose. The main results were: conceptual
              planning engages bilateral activation of the precuneus. Successful
              lexical retrieval is accompanied - particularly in comparison to
              unsolved word-finding difficulties - by the left middle and
              superior temporal gyrus. Syntactic completeness is reflected in
              activation of the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) (area 44). In
              sum, the method has proven to be useful for investigating the

              between these differences at various stages of production is the
              need for manual annotation of fine-grained properties of speech.
              We introduce a new method for automatically analyzing voice onset
              time (VOT), a key phonetic feature indexing differences in sound
              systems cross-linguistically. In contrast to previous approaches,

              be possible to observe long-distance interactions; effects that
              arise at one level of processing influence multiple subsequent
              stages of representation and processing. We examine the hypothesis
              that disruptions arising in nonform-based levels of
              planning-specifically, lexical selection-should modulate
              articulatory processing. A novel automatic phonetic analysis
              method was used to examine productions in a paradigm yielding both
              general disruptions to formulation processes and, more
              specifically, overt errors during lexical selection. This analysis
              method allowed us to examine articulatory disruptions at multiple
              levels of analysis, from whole words to individual segments.
              Baseline performance by young adults was contrasted with young
              speakers' performance under time pressure (which previous work has
              argued increases interaction between planning and articulation)
              and performance by older adults (who may have difficulties
              inhibiting nontarget representations, leading to heightened
              interactive effects). The results revealed the presence of
              interactive effects. Our new analysis techniques revealed these
              effects were strongest in initial portions of responses,
              suggesting that speech is initiated as soon as the first segment
              has been planned. Interactive effects did not increase under
              response pressure, suggesting interaction between planning and
              articulation is relatively fixed. Unexpectedly, lexical selection
              disruptions appeared to yield some degree of facilitation in
              articulatory processing (possibly reflecting semantic facilitation
              of target retrieval) and older adults showed weaker, not stronger
              interactive effects (possibly reflecting weakened connections

               phrases? NPs embedded inside other NPs are not accessible to
               predication, so that in a sentence with a subject NP containing a
               PP modifier such as The cup on the table is green or The dog with
               the bone is blue, the adjectival predicate has scope over the
               highest but not the embedded nominal referent (Arsenijevic \&
               Hinzen 2012). We used a coloring task to examine children's
               comprehension of sentences containing these complex NPs,
               comparing PP modifiers (locative and comitatives) to coordinated
               NPs (The cup and the table are green), where both referents are
               accessible. Three- to five-year-old children were highly accurate
               with control and coordinate sentences, and performed well with
               locative PPs, but were not different from chance level for
               comitative sentences, which many children treated as coordinates.
               That children differentiate between coordinate and locative
               sentences provides evidence that children have early access to
               the syntax-semantics of complex nominals. The contrast between
               locatives and comitatives suggests that comprehension is not
               merely guided by subject agreement (since the agreement patterns
               are the same for both types of PP-modified subjects), and that
               children still need to learn the lexical semantics of
               prepositions. Diachronically, languages with comitative modifiers
               evolve into language with comitative coordination (Haspelmath
               2007). Thus, we propose that these error patterns for comitative
               prepositions can be explained by the assumption that children's

              participants described pictures of two-character transitive events
              in Dutch (Experiment 1) and Chinese (Experiment 2). Focus was
              manipulated by presenting questions before each picture. In the
              Neutral condition, participants first heard ``What is happening
              here?'' In the Object or Subject Focus conditions, the questions
              asked about the Object or Subject character (What is the policeman
              stopping? Who is stopping the truck?). The target response was the
              same in all conditions (The policeman is stopping the truck). In
              both experiments, sentence formulation in the Neutral condition
              showed the expected pattern of speakers fixating the subject
              character (policeman) before the object character (truck). In
              contrast, in the focus conditions speakers rapidly directed their
              gaze preferentially only to the character they needed to encode to
              answer the question (the new, or focused, character). The timing

              depicted on the picture or written in the sentence. The target
              response was expected to have the same structure and content in

              the process by which serial ordering is achieved in speech. The
              present study focused on the distribution of sequential speech
              errors within multi-word prosodic units to determine whether such
              units are relevant to speech planning, and, if so, how. Forty
              native English-speaking undergraduate students were asked to
              produce sentences that varied in length and in the extent to which
              certain phonological features were repeated (tongue twisters or
              not). Participants prepared their utterances in advance of
              speaking and were coached to be as fluent as possible once they
              started speaking. The goal was to ensure the production of
              well-structured utterances, while maximizing the number of errors
              produced, and minimizing the effects that excessive
              self-correction might have on prosodic structure. Speech errors
              were perceptually identified in the recorded speech and
              categorized. Strong and weak prosodic boundaries were
              prosodically-transcribed in sentences with sequencing errors.
              Speech error patterns were found to correspond well with the
              boundaries of the multi-word prosodic units defined by the strong
              and weak prosodic boundaries. In particular, the number of
              sequencing errors was found to vary as a function of position
              within a unit such that the fewest errors were found in initial
              position, more occurred in early-mid position, and even more
              occurred in late-mid position. This pattern of increasing errors
              across the multi-word prosodic unit was referred to as the
              cumulative error pattern. The analyses also revealed a final
              position effect. When multi-word prosodic units occurred in
              utterance-initial or utterance-medial position, a disproportionate
              number of errors occurred in the final position of the unit.
              However, when the units occurred in utterance-final position, more
              errors occurred in late-mid position than in final position. The
              cumulative error pattern and final position effect are interpreted

              to investigate empty pause distribution and associations between
              pause variables and linguistic elements in aphasia. Eighteen
              patients with chronic aphasia following a left hemisphere stroke
              were recruited. The control group consisted of 19 healthy adults
              matched for age, gender, and years of formal schooling. Speech
              samples from both groups were transcribed, and silent pauses were

              with significantly different thresholds between the two

              classification into two distinct groups of pauses for each

              the patient and control group, prominently with regard to long

              with fundamental linguistics elements, such as mean length of

              an index of internal cognitive processes supporting sentence

               delivers a `conjunction' reading), Indirect Recursion, and
               Generalized Transformations. The essential argument is that
               Direct Recursion captures the first stage of each recursive
               structure. Acquisition evidence will then be provided from both
               naturalistic data and experimentation that adjectives,
               possessives, verbal compounds, and sentence complements all point
               to con-junction as the first stage. Then it will be argued that
               Indirect Recursion captures the Strong Minimalist Thesis, which
               allows periodic Transfer and interpretation. Why is recursion
               delayed and not immediate? It is argued that an interpretation of
               Generalized Transformations in the spirit of Tree Adjoining
               Grammar offers a route to explanation. A labeling algorithm
               combines with Generalized Transformations to provide different
               labels for recursive structures projection. Recursion is then
               achieved by substitution of a recursive node for a simple node.
               One simple case is to substitute a Maximal Projection for a
               simple non-branching lexical node. A more complex case ---
               essential to acquisition --- is to substitute a category for a
               lexical string. Consequently, a computational `psychological

               how German-speaking children discover which forms of embedding
               are recursive. In German, possessive modifiers are expressed by
               several structural options (i.e., genitive case, possessive -s,
               relative clauses, and von-prepositional phrases, placed to the
               left or the right of the possessum), of which only some are
               recursive. In contrast, other forms of phrasal noun modification
               are more homogeneously realized as two basic structures (right
               branching PPs or relative clauses), both recursive. We examine
               whether recursive possessives are delayed in German L1
               acquisition compared to other forms of recursive modification. A
               referential elicitation task tested 5-year-olds? (n = 21) and
               adults? (n = 22) production of recursive modification of
               possessives, comitatives, locatives, and relational structures.
               Overall, production of recursive possessives is not inhibited by
               structural diversity, relative to the other conditions.
               Children?s target responses to the possessive condition differed
               from adults? in that children reduced the inventory of structural
               types and relied more commonly on certain forms that adults used
               less frequently. These results indicate that structural diversity
               does not delay children?s mastery of recursive expressions in a
               given domain and that structural complexity can determine the
               overall timing of the onset of recursive modification, but this
               fails to help explain performance across domains or the actual
               options children select.},

               constituents. Experimental and corpus literature indicates that
               comprehending recursive structures is difficult for children.
               Since recursion is a fundamental property of language, the result
               of the application of core minimal tools (merge, label, and
               select), why does it present an acquisition challenge? We propose
               that while Merge itself is universal, its application is
               determined by selection, which is extensively parameterized. We
               investigate whether children's difficulties can be defined in
               terms of the complexity of the selectional demands involved. This
               investigation leads to three empirical questions: i. How does NP
               recursion compare to NP coordination in acquisition? ii. Do
               children acquire each level of recursion independently or is
               recursion triggered automatically once the initial selectional
               requirements are acquired? iii. Are there differences in the
               acquisition of different types of nominal recursion? We compare
               the selectional requirements of English genitives, PPs, and NP
               coordination. Our syntactic analysis suggests that genitive
               recursion has more complex selectional demands than PP recursion.
               We designed a study eliciting production of two level embedded
               prepositional and genitive NPs. Preschool-aged English-speaking
               children (n?=?46) and adults (n?=?11) participated in an
               elicitation study. Children were comparable to adults in their
               ability to produce three coordinated NPs, but had substantial
               difficulty linking three NPs using recursion. First- and
               second-level embedding were clearly distinct steps in
               development. These findings have implications for the
               independence of phrasal and selectional development in children
               and for our understanding of structural complexity in child
               language and in theory.},

              domains of human language and thus, it has been claimed to be the
              only part of language that is specific to humans (Hauser, Chomsky,
              and Fitch 2002). However, in the past decade, both the claims
              that, recursion is the central component of the ``narrow faculty of
              language'' and that, it should be present in all languages have
              been the object of intense debate (cf. Pinker \& Jackendoff, 2005;
              Everett, 2005). This debate triggered the exploration of new
              frontiers in the examination of embedded structures, which have
              been examined in acquisition and in processing and have been shown
              to be implemented through a wide array of linguistic resources in
              different languages. This paper presents an acoustic description
              and a neuro-psycholinguistic analysis (ERP/EEG) of an uncommon
              cognitive device to embed relative clauses. It is implemented in
              Karaj{\'a}, a Macro-Je language spoken in Central Brazil, which uses
              pitch accent to signal relativization: (i) [tori do``rode] „the
              white man arrived`` versus (ii) [tori doro``de] „the white man who
              arrived``, first described in Ribeiro as stress shift (2006). The
              major interest in studying this phenomenon is because in Karaj{\'a},
              more than structuring envelopes for acts of speech, prosody codes
              directly onto the central syntactic algorithm of recursion. We
              found evidence in favor of a stronger facilitation to process a
              coordinated structure than a recursive structure. We found smaller
              RTs and amplitudes in the EEG related to the coordinated
              conditions versus the embedding conditions. Also, it seems that
              even though embedding is harder to launch, hierarchical
              structuring makes it easier to process in the third embedding,
              when comprehenders learn they are in an embedding mode.
              Coordination, on the other hand, being a default, is easier to
              launch, but it seems to become progressively harder as it does not
              benefit from hierarchical structuring.},

               Mazandarani as the L2, with Persian as the language of
               communication. English and Mazandarani pattern similarly in the

               nouns and possessive adjectives come before nouns. In contrast,

               and recursive readings to complex DPs with embedded modifiers and
               gradually reduce the number of conjunctive responses to the
               advantage of recursive ones. At age 7 neither the monolinguals

              for improving education has been largely ignored. Cognitive and

              techniques are not generally applied in education nor taught in
              education schools. In fact, teachers often use instructional
              practices known to be wrong (i.e., massing rather than
              interleaving examples to explain a topic). We identify three
              general principles that are inexpensive to implement and have been
              shown in both laboratory and field experiments to improve
              learning: (1) distribution (spacing and interleaving) of practice
              in learning facts and skills; (2) retrieval practice (via self

              task: ``have you seen this item before? yes/no'') where quantifying
              performance is deeply dependent on counterfactual reasoning that
              depends on the (unknowable) distribution of underlying memory
              signals. As a result of this difficulty, different literatures in
              memory research (e.g., visual working memory, eyewitness
              identification, picture memory, etc) have settled on a variety of
              fundamentally different metrics to get performance measures from
              such tasks (e.g., A′, corrected hit rate, percent correct, d′,
              diagnosticity ratios, K values, etc.), even though these metrics

               Whereas proponents of DM have virtually completely ignored the

@article{Guerrero2020-hf,
	abstract = {The acquisition and representation of natural numbers have been a
              central topic in cognitive science. However, a key question in
              this topic about how humans acquire the capacity to understand
              that numbers make 'infinite use of finite means' (or that numbers
              are generative) has been left unanswered. While previous theories
              rely on the idea of the successor principle, we propose an
              alternative hypothesis that children's understanding of the
              syntactic rules for building complex numerals-or numerical
              syntax-is a crucial foundation for the acquisition of number
              concepts. In two independent studies, we assessed children's
              understanding of numerical syntax by probing their knowledge about
              the embedded structure of cardinal numbers using a novel task
              called Give-a-number Base-10 (Give-N10). In Give-N10, children
              were asked to give a large number of items (e.g., 32 items) from a
              pool that is organized in sets of ten items. Children's knowledge
              about the embedded structure of numbers (e.g., knowing that
              thirty-two items are composed of three tens and two ones) was
              assessed from their ability to use those sets. Study 1 tested
              English-speaking 4- to 10-year-olds and revealed that children's
              understanding of the embedded structure of numbers emerges
              relatively late in development (several months into kindergarten),
              beyond when they are capable of making a semantic induction over a
              local sequence of numbers. Moreover, performance in Give-N10 was
              predicted by other task measures that assessed children's
              knowledge about the syntactic rules that govern numerals (such as
              counting fluency), demonstrating the validity of the measure. In
              Study 2, this association was tested again in monolingual Korean
              kindergarteners (5-6 years), as we aimed to test the same effect
              in a language with a highly regular numeral system. It replicated
              the association between Give-N10 performance and counting fluency,
              and it also demonstrated that Korean-speaking children understand
              the embedded structure of cardinal numbers earlier in the
              acquisition path than English-speaking peers, suggesting that
              regularity in numerical syntax facilitates the acquisition of
              generative properties of numbers. Based on these observations and
              our theoretical analysis of the literature, we propose that the
              syntax for building complex numerals, not the successor principle,
              represents a structural platform for numerical thinking in young
              children.},

	abstract = {Language is uniquely human, but its acquisition may involve
              cognitive capacities shared with other species. During
              development, language experience alters speech sound (phoneme)
              categorization. Newborn infants distinguish the phonemes in all
              languages but by 10 months show adult-like greater sensitivity to
              native language phonemic contrasts than non-native contrasts.
              Distributional theories account for phonetic learning by positing
              that infants infer category boundaries from modal distributions of
              speech sounds along acoustic continua. For example, tokens of the
              sounds /b/ and /p/ cluster around different mean voice onset
              times. To disambiguate overlapping distributions, contextual
              theories propose that phonetic category learning is informed by
              higher-level patterns (e.g., words) in which phonemes normally
              occur. For example, the vowel sounds /Ι/ and /e/ can occupy
              similar perceptual spaces but can be distinguished in the context
              of ``with'' and ``well.'' Both distributional and contextual cues
              appear to function in speech acquisition. Non-human species also
              benefit from distributional cues for category learning, but
              whether category learning benefits from contextual information in
              non-human animals is unknown. The use of higher-level patterns to
              guide lower-level category learning may reflect uniquely human
              capacities tied to language acquisition or more general learning
              abilities reflecting shared neurobiological mechanisms. Using
              songbirds, European starlings, we show that higher-level pattern
              learning covertly enhances categorization of the natural
              communication sounds. This observation mirrors the support for
              contextual theories of phonemic category learning in humans and

              new information (e.g., new words). However, equally important are
              changes in how the system processes known information. For
              example, a wealth of studies has suggested dramatic changes over
              development in how efficiently children recognize familiar words,
              but it is unknown what kind of experience-dependent mechanisms of
              plasticity give rise to such changes in real-time processing. We
              examined the plasticity of the language processing system by
              testing whether a fundamental aspect of spoken word recognition,
              lexical interference, can be altered by experience. Adult
              participants were trained on a set of familiar words over a series
              of 4 tasks. In the high-competition (HC) condition, tasks were
              designed to encourage coactivation of similar words (e.g., net and
              neck) and to require listeners to resolve this competition. Tasks
              were similar in the low-competition (LC) condition, but did not
              enhance this competition. Immediately after training, interlexical
              interference was tested using a visual world paradigm task.
              Participants in the HC group resolved interference to a fuller
              degree than those in the LC group, demonstrating that experience
              can shape the way competition between words is resolved. TRACE
              simulations showed that the observed late differences in the
              pattern of interference resolution can be attributed to
              differences in the strength of lexical inhibition. These findings

              competition/interference processes, and suggest an

              space of ɸ-probes as a result of the cyclic interaction of Merge
              and Agree (cyclic Agree). Empirical evidence for such effects has
              come from the interaction of Agree with external Merge, but these
              accounts make the additional predictions that such interactions
              should also arise from the interaction of Agree with movement. In
              this paper, we argue based on evidence from Hindi-Urdu that
              movement may feed cyclic Agree in the same way as external Merge,
              bearing out this key prediction. The central empirical
              generalizations that we argue for are that (i) A-scrambling of an

              configurations, (ii) there is nonetheless a preference for

              principled explanation of these generalizations. Crucial to this

              with movement, (ii) there is a preference for agreement with
              elements c-commanded by the head that hosts the probe (first-cycle

              are grammatical or not -- are enforced during real-time
              processing. One such constraint in Mainstream American English is
              subject-verb agreement, which requires the verb's number feature
              matches that of its subject, irrespective of the number of any
              other noun phrases in the sentence. Past work has demonstrated
              that participants often make errors when enforcing this constraint
              when distractor noun phrases, called attractors, have a number
              feature different from the subject. Franck, Lassi, Frauenfelder \&

              interruptions in the speech stream. Previous work probing memory
              for disfluent speech shows memory benefits for disfluent compared
              to fluent materials. Complementary evidence from studies of
              language production and comprehension have been argued to show
              that different disfluency types appear in distinct contexts and,
              as a result, serve as a meaningful cue. If the disfluency-memory
              boost is a result of sensitivity to these form-meaning mappings,
              forms of disfluency that cue new upcoming information (fillers and
              pauses) may produce a stronger memory boost compared to forms that
              reflect speaker difficulty (repetitions). If the disfluency-memory
              boost is simply due to the attentional-orienting properties of a
              disruption to fluent speech, different disfluency forms may

              interruptions. Experiments 3 and 4 examined the scope of the
              disfluency-memory boost to probe its cognitive underpinnings.
              Across the four experiments, we observed a disfluency-memory boost
              for three types of disfluency that were tested. This boost was
              local and position dependent, only manifesting when the disfluency
              immediately preceded a critical memory probe word at the end of
              the sentence. Our findings reveal a short-lived disfluency-memory
              boost that manifests at the end of the sentence but is evoked by
              multiple types of disfluent forms, consistent with the idea that
              disfluencies bring attentional focus to immediately upcoming
              material. The downstream consequence of this localized memory
              benefit is better understanding and encoding of the speaker's

              comprehension can account for a well-known phenomenon---subject-verb
              agreement errors (e.g. The key to the cabinets are{\ldots}). A series of
              experiments provides evidence that: a) agreement errors are
              associated with misrepresentations of the sentence consistent with
              noisy-channel inferences and b) agreement errors are rationally
              sensitive to environmental statistics and properties of the noise.
              These findings support the hypothesis that agreement errors in

              frequent words. However, there are other factors at play, such as
              an early ``noun bias'' (relative to input frequency, toddlers
              learn nouns faster than verbs) and a ``content-word bias''
              (content words are acquired disproportionately to function words).
              This paper follows up reports of a puzzling phenomenon within
              verb-learning, where ``experiencer-object'' emotion verbs (A
              frightened/angered/delighted B) are lower frequency but learned
              earlier than ``experiencer-subject'' emotion verbs (A
              feared/hated/loved B). In addition to the possibility that the
              aforementioned results are a fluke or due to some confound, prior
              work has suggested several possible explanations:
              experiencer-object (``frighten-type'') verbs have higher type
              frequency, encode a causal agent as the sentential subject, and
              perhaps describe a more salient perspective on the described
              event. In three experiments, we cast doubt on all three possible
              explanations. The first experiment replicates and extends the
              prior findings regarding emotion verbs, ruling out several
              possible confounds and concerns. The second and third experiments
              investigate acquisition of chase/flee verbs and give/get verbs,
              which reveal surprising findings that are not explained by the
              aforementioned hypotheses. We conclude that these findings

                 computational modeling has focused mainly on the study of
                 perception-based mechanisms like cross-situational learning.
                 However, children do not learn only by exposure to the input.
                 As soon as they start to talk, they practice their knowledge in
                 social interactions and they receive feedback from their
                 caregivers. In this work, we propose a model integrating both

                 neural networks which we train on a large corpus of

                 undesirable consequences: first, the SMT assumes that the
                 Borer-Chomsky Conjecture is true; in other words, that all
                 syntactic variation across languages is due to the lexicon.
                 Second, it assumes that there can be no ordering restrictions
                 on Merge, because it would imply the existence of a
                 linguistically proprietary entity that is not simply Merge. I
                 first present recent crosslinguistic evidence from the
                 literature based on case and agreement that the Borer-Chomsky
                 Conjecture alone is not sufficient to account for syntactic
                 variation, based on Baker (2008)'s survey on case and
                 agreement. I then present evidence for the existence of
                 ordering restrictions on Merge, based on Rizzi (1997)'s
                 cartographic distinction between high and low complementizers.
                 I argue that this distinction is attested crosslinguistically,

	abstract = {This article presents a theory of recursion in thinking and
              language. In the logic of computability, a function maps one or
              more sets to another, and it can have a recursive definition that
              is semi-circular, i.e., referring in part to the function itself.
              Any function that is computable - and many are not - can be
              computed in an infinite number of distinct programs. Some of these
              programs are semi-circular too, but they needn't be, because
              repeated loops of instructions can compute any recursive function.
              Our theory aims to explain how naive individuals devise informal
              programs in natural language, and is itself implemented in a
              computer program that creates programs. Participants in our
              experiments spontaneously simulate loops of instructions in
              kinematic mental models. They rely on such loops to compute
              recursive functions for rearranging the order of cars in trains on
              a track with a siding. Kolmogorov complexity predicts the relative
              difficulty of abducing such programs - for easy rearrangements,
              such as reversing the order of the cars, to difficult ones, such
              as splitting a train in two and interleaving the two resulting
              halves (equivalent to a faro shuffle). This rearrangement uses
              both the siding and part of the track as working memories,
              shuffling cars between them, and so it relies on the power of a
              linear-bounded computer. Linguistic evidence implies that this
              power is more than necessary to compose the meanings of sentences
              in natural language from those of their grammatical constituents.},

              have been made, the empirical evidence so far is far from
              unequivocal. It is compatible with several theories, including

               Concord is a regular property of Moksha nominal syntax so that

               foster lexical acquisition must first have identified the
               semantic information that a syntactic context provides. Based on
               the semantic seed hypothesis, children discover the semantic
               predictiveness of syntactic contexts by tracking the distribution
               of familiar words. We propose that these learning mechanisms

              While Listening (LWL) task at 18 months (corrected for degree of

              efficiency of real-time spoken language comprehension in terms of
              accuracy and speed (RT) of processing. At 4 ½ years, children were

               optionality is not reducible to phonological or morphological
               factors. Rather, the source of optionality is in the syntax.
               Specifically, the distinction between arguments generated in the

               position governs the pattern. Only base-complements control

               However, agreement is fundamentally a syntactic relation. In this
               paper, I examine the processing of default agreement with clausal
               subjects (?[cp That the doctors studied hard] was reassuring?)
               vs. the processing of agreement with near-synonymous NPs (?[np

               NP subject case, there is a syntactic agreement dependency
               between the head noun fact and the verb was but not in the the CP

              small samples and limited observations. Online testing holds
              promise as a way to achieve more representative and robust, better
              powered experiments. As participants do not have to visit in
              person, it is easier to access populations living further away
              from a developmental lab, enabling testing of more diverse
              populations (e.g., urban vs rural areas, various different
              nationalities or geographies), both within and beyond the
              researcher's home country. Furthermore, due to the codified nature
              of browser-based online testing, it is possible for multiple labs
              to carry out the exact same study, allowing for better

               unsupervised learning is plausible. I challenge this view,
               synthesising five lines of developmental, phonetic and

               insufficient given the statistics of speech (including

              phonemes, characters, words) in human language sequences increase,
              the strength of the long-range relationships between those
              elements decays following a power law. This power-law relationship
              has been attributed variously to long-range sequential

              and well defined through about age 12. We investigated the
              cognitive changes that may be responsible for such development
              using a visual world paradigm experiment based on (McMurray,
              Tanenhaus, \& Aslin, 2002). Children from 3 age groups (7-8,
              12-13, and 17-18 years) heard a token from either a b/p or s/∫
              continua spanning 2 words (beach/peach, ship/sip) and selected its
              referent from a screen containing 4 pictures of potential lexical

              measure of how strongly children were committing to each candidate
              as perception unfolds in real-time. Results showed an ongoing
              sharpening of speech categories through 18, which was particularly
              apparent during the early stages of real-time perception. When
              analysis targeted to specifically within-category sensitivity to

              unitary construct, and its consistency across different language
              properties remains unclear. In a meta-analysis of
              auditory-linguistic statistical learning research spanning the
              last 25 years, we evaluated how learning varies across different
              language properties in infants, children, and adults and surveyed
              the methodological trends in the literature. We found robust
              learning across stimuli (syllables, words, etc.) in infants, and
              across stimuli and structures (adjacent dependencies, non-adjacent
              dependencies, etc.) in adults, with larger effect sizes when
              multiple cues were present. However, the analysis also showed
              significant publication bias and revealed a tendency toward using
              a narrow range of simplified language properties, including in the
              strength of the transitional probabilities used during training.
              Bayes factor analyses revealed prevalent data insensitivity of

              amount of exposure and transitional probability strength, which

               nearly every word class that can be present inside nominal

              (CSI) paradigm was employed that required naming several exemplars
              of semantic categories within a seemingly unrelated sequence of
              objects. RT is expected to increase linearly for each additional
              exemplar of a category. In Experiment 1, CSI effects in naming
              times described in lab-based studies were replicated. In
              Experiment 2, the responses were typed on participants' computer
              keyboards, and the first correct key press was used for RT
              analysis. This novel response assessment yielded a qualitatively
              similar, very robust CSI effect. Besides technical ease of
              application, collecting typewritten responses and automatic data
              preprocessing substantially reduce the work load for language
              production research. Results of both experiments open new
              perspectives for research on RT effects in language experiments
              across a wide range of contexts. JavaScript- and R-based

              evidence suggests that purely statistical clustering methods may
              not be sufficient to explain speech sound acquisition. To model
              early development of speech perception, the present study used a
              two-layer network trained with Rescorla-Wagner learning equations,
              an implementation of discriminative, error-driven learning. The
              model contained no a priori linguistic units, such as phonemes or

              acoustic speech signal were learned from the surrounding speech
              signal, with spectral components extracted from an audio recording
              of child-directed speech as both inputs and outputs of the model.

	abstract = {ABSTRACTHow does linguistic structure affect children?s
               developing cardinal number knowledge? The bootstrapping theory
               proposes that children might use syntactic information provided
               by known words such as quantifiers to bootstrap the meanings of
               unfamiliar words such as number words. Prior studies of numeral
               and quantifier development have indicated that the bootstrapping
               mechanism that children can use to discover numeral meanings
               might work differently in different languages. Nevertheless,
               support for this conclusion remains preliminary. The present
               study explored this hypothesis through an investigation of the
               possible relations between cardinal number knowledge and
               quantifier comprehension in Mandarin Chinese-speaking children.
               Notably, in contrast with previous studies, this study also
               offered a glimpse into children?s receptive vocabulary
               development and its relation with cardinal number knowledge and
               quantifier comprehension. Results showed that cardinal number
               knowledge did not seem to be correlated with quantifier
               comprehension (both ?exact? and ?non-exact? quantifiers) when
               controlling for such covariates as children?s age, gender, parent
               education, and family income. Moreover, children?s receptive
               vocabulary size explained a significant amount of variance in
               their quantifier knowledge over and above children?s age, gender,
               parent education, and family income, but not in their cardinal
               number development over and above these covariates. These results
               provide further evidence for the hypothesis that while the
               bootstrapping mechanism may facilitate number word learning in
               children speaking languages like English, it might play a lesser
               role in children speaking classifier languages such as Mandarin
               Chinese. Implications for the role that general receptive
               vocabulary plays in the acquisition of number words and

               whether spontaneous repetitions of young children are produced
               with a faster articulation rate than their original utterances.
               Twelve monolingual English-speaking children were observed at
               four time points between 2;0 and 3;0 years of age. A significant

               to communicative disorders. Work in language acquisition commonly
               focuses on how lexical knowledge?knowledge of words? sound
               patterns and meanings?is acquired. But lexical knowledge is
               insufficient to account for skilled language use. Sophisticated
               real-time processes must decode the sound pattern of words and
               interpret them appropriately. We review work that bridges this
               gap by using sensitive real-time measures (eye tracking in the
               visual world paradigm) of school-age children?s processing of
               highly familiar words. This work reveals that the development of
               word recognition skills can be characterized by changes in the
               rate at which decisions unfold in the lexical system (the
               activation rate). Moreover, contrary to the standard view that
               these real-time skills largely develop during infancy and
               toddlerhood, they develop slowly, at least through adolescence.
               In contrast, language disorders can be linked to differences in
               the ultimate degree to which competing interpretations are
               suppressed (competition resolution), and these differences can be

              genitive case marking and subjecthood in Turkish, but not in
              English. In the present research, we test an alternative
              explanation in which Turkish number agreement attraction effects
              are due to a potential confound in Lago et al.'s experiment, as a
              result of which subject head nouns were locally ambiguous between
              the possessive and the accusative case. We hypothesized that this
              ambiguity may have inhibited the availability of the head noun as
              an agreement controller as the accusative is a non-subject case in
              Turkish. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a speeded
              acceptability judgment experiment and our results suggest that
              case-ambiguity does not play a role in agreement attraction, and
              thus lends credibility to the claim that genitive noun phrases may
              function as attractors in Turkish due to the association between
              genitive case and subjecthood.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the relation between head movement
              and the synthesis-periphrasis distinction in the verbal domain. We
              use the term ``synthesis'' to refer to verbal expressions in which
              the lexical verb bears all the verbal inflection in a clause. In
              contrast, a periphrastic verbal expression additionally contains
              an auxiliary verb (``be'' or ``have''), and verbal inflection is
              distributed between the lexical verb and the auxiliary. We argue
              for a one-way correlation between head movement and periphrasis,
              first observed in Pietraszko 2017, which we refer to as the
              ``Synthesis-Movement Generalization'': If the lexical verb moves
              to T, it must form a synthetic expression with T, that is,
              periphrasis is impossible. Importantly, the inverse correlation
              doesn't hold, as synthesis is compatible with, but does not
              entail, head movement of the lexical verb to T. We argue that
              existing theories of the synthesis/periphrasis distinction are
              either too weak and predict no correlation at all, or too strong
              and predict a two-way correlation. We further argue that the
              Synthesis-Movement Generalization can be explained by the
              hypothesis that both head movement and periphrasis are related to
              selection. More specifically, we propose that head movement is
              parasitic on a selectional relation (following Svenonius 1994,
              Matushansky 2006, and Preminger 2019) and that periphrasis is
              Merge of an auxiliary verb triggered by a selectional feature of T
              (D{\'e}chaine 1995, Cowper 2010, Pietraszko 2017). This analysis
              derives the complementarity of head movement of the lexical verb
              to T and the presence of an auxiliary from the fact that T's
              selectional feature can be satisfied by the lexical verb or an
              auxiliary, but not both. If T's selectional requirement is
              satisfied by an auxiliary, it's not satisfied by the lexical verb,
              so the lexical verb can't undergo head movement to T.},

              Developmental research has largely relied on in-lab testing with
              trained experimenters. This constraint provides a narrow window
              into infant cognition and impedes large-scale data collection in
              families from diverse socioeconomic, geographic, and cultural
              backgrounds. Here we introduce a new open-source methodology for
              automatically analyzing infant eye-tracking data collected on
              personal devices in the home. Using algorithms from computer
              vision, machine learning, and ecological psychology, we develop an
              online webcam-linked eye tracker (OWLET) that provides robust
              estimation of infants' point of gaze from smartphone and webcam
              recordings of infant assessments in the home. We validate OWLET in
              a large sample of 7-month-old infants (N = 127) tested remotely,

              remains scarce, however. This paper illustrates how a
              hypothetico-deductive approach can contribute to our understanding
              of L2 speech rhythm. We consider cross-sectional data on
              prominence alternations in German learner speech from the
              viewpoint of two dynamic frameworks: The Ontogeny Phylogeny Model
              (OPM) and the Linguistic Theory of L2 Phonological Development
              (LTD). While both theories deal with L1-independent, universal
              forces in L2 acquisition, the OPM further considers the role of L1
              transfer, similarity, and markedness. The predictions we formulate
              based on the two models lead us to pursue distinct methodological
              strategies. While our reading of the OPM prompts us to measure
              speech rhythm as a single, global category of speech, the LTD
              suggests a more nuanced, componential approach to L2 rhythm. Our

               the contexts in which the forms are produced. In addition to
               considering input effects, we also draw on various tendencies
               that children evince in the face of variable input to explain the
               pathway of development, including regularization and assigning
               different meanings to different forms. The article also includes
               suggestions for testing the hypotheses generated by the proposed
               pathway of development, which we illustrate by drawing on the
               acquisition of variable Spanish subject pronoun expression.},

@article{Norris2018-or,
	abstract = {It is standardly assumed that nominals in the languages of the
               world are syntactically complex in the typical case, being made
               up of not just NP, but one or more functional projections, e.g.,
               DP (Abney 1987). Recently, this assumption has been questioned,
               especially for languages without articles (Bo{\v s}kovi{\'c} 2005, et
               seq.). The alternative proposal holds that nominals in
               Serbo-Croatian (and more strongly, languages without articles in
               general) lack the DP projection, and that this difference has a
               variety of syntactic consequences. In this paper, I investigate
               the nominal extended projection of another language without
               articles, Estonian (Finno-Ugric). On the basis of a number of
               facts about Estonian's system of adnominal genitives, I conclude
               that nominals in Estonian should not be given the same analysis
               as those in Serbo-Croatian. I propose instead that Estonian's
               nominals are DPs. I then propose that indefinite pronouns and
               wh-determiners instantiate the category D0 in the language,
               arguing that DP does more cross-linguistically than host
               articles. I conclude that nominal structure in languages without
               articles can be just as complex as nominal structure in languages
               with articles.},

	abstract = {Nilo-Saharan languages are well-known for their complicated system
              of nominal number marking, which features a variety of singulative
              and plural affixes (Dimmendaal 2000). Even though these systems
              have received some attention in the typological literature, there
              has been limited theoretical work on their implications for the
              morphosyntax of number cross-linguistically. The goal of this
              paper is to fill this gap, by providing an analysis of nominal
              number morphology in Kipsigis (Nilotic, Kenya), based on data from
              original fieldwork. First, I show that singulatives in Kipsigis
              are true allomorphs of singular number, unlike singulatives with a
              classifier function in languages like Ojibwe (Mathieu 2012). The
              descriptive term `singulative' is therefore misleading, as it
              corresponds to two very different types of morphemes. Second, I
              claim that the tripartite system of number marking of Kipsigis and
              other Nilo-Saharan languages is due to the classification of nouns
              into morphosyntactic classes defined by the presence of inherent
              number features on little n; the interaction of these features
              with interpretable number features on the functional projection
              Num (Ritter 1991 a.o.) in the post-syntactic component gives rise
              to the exponence pattern that we observe. Finally, my analysis
              corroborates the existence of noun classification based on number,
              which has only been argued for Kiowa-Tanoan before (Harbour 2007).
              The existence of three number classes in Kipsigis can only be
              explained by reference to bivalent number features; number-based
              noun classification systems thus strongly support the view that
              number features are bivalent and not privative, which is also
              argued by Harbour (2007, 2011) for Kiowa.},

	abstract = {In Spanish clitic-doubling constructions, the clitic should agree
              in number with its coreferential doubled noun phrase. However, the
              present corpus analysis with data from 21 Spanish varieties
              reveals that, under certain structural configurations, number
              agreement is not always realized on the third-person dative
              clitic. In fact, the data shows that non-agreement appears to be
              the norm when the indirect object is a lexical noun phrase (77 vs.
              23\%). In this paper, I investigate two possible explanations for
              this phenomenon: (i) a processing account via an attraction effect
              and (ii) a syntactic account based on intervention effects. These
              two hypotheses make clear and testable predictions that I examine
              by means of conditional inference trees and Bayesian generalized
              mixed-effects logistic regression modeling. The results of the
              statistical analyses are incompatible with an intervention account
              because this type of phenomenon is not sensitive to semantic
              features of the intervening element or to the true controller of
              agreement. Thus, I propose that the data is best analyzed as the
              interplay between attraction and the morphosyntax of the unmarked.
              In Spanish, this results in attraction effects from the DO in the
              unmarked word order and inanimate IOs showing a sort of
              differential dative marking, where animate IOs show a preference
              for full agreement. The findings reported herein show evidence of
              a complex and highly dynamic agreement mechanism of the clitic and
              highlight the probabilistic nature of morphosyntactic processes.},

	abstract = {As a spoken word unfolds over time, similar sounding words (cap
              and cat) compete until one word ``wins''. Lexical competition
              becomes more efficient from infancy through adolescence. We
              examined one potential mechanism underlying this development:
              lexical inhibition, by which activated candidates suppress
              competitors. In Experiment 1, younger (7-8 years) and older (12-13
              years) children heard words (cap) in which the onset was
              manipulated to briefly boost competition from a cohort competitor
              (cat). This was compared to a condition with a nonword (cack)
              onset that would not inhibit the target. Words were presented in a
              visual world task during which eye movements were recorded. Both
              groups showed less looking to the target when perceiving the
              competitor-splice relative to the nonword-splice, showing
              engagement of lexical inhibition. Exploratory analyses of
              linguistic adaptation across the experiment revealed that older
              children demonstrated consistent lexical inhibition across the
              experiment and younger children did not, initially showing no
              effect in the first half of trials and then a robust effect in the
              latter half. In Experiment 2, adults also displayed consistent
              lexical inhibition in the same task. These findings suggest that
              younger children do not consistently engage lexical inhibition in
              typical listening but can quickly bring it online in response to
              certain linguistic experiences. Computational modeling showed that
              age-related differences are best explained by increased engagement
              of inhibition rather than growth in activation. These findings
              suggest that continued development of lexical inhibition in later
              childhood may underlie increases in efficiency of spoken word
              recognition.},

              either difficult to compute, rely on the statistical notion of

              is to explain how young children solve the mapping problem. The
              mapping problem asks how language learners connect a label to its
              referent. Mapping is one part of word learning, however, it does
              not reflect other critical components of word meaning
              construction, such as the encoding of lexico-semantic relations
